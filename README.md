Multi-agent coordination Environment (for) frameworking frameworks

# Notice
This project is in the conceptual stage but will be developed in the clear as an Open Source formalization and generalization of concepts abstracted from independent experiments conducted within two agentic coding environments Claude Code and Gemini CLI.  The concepts are intented to be portable but ongoing work will be required before any of this is useful as a basis for serious projects.  

# Thesis
Agentic AI coding systems are immensely powerful, but with that power and raw intelligence comes the need for the restraints of wisdom.  When AI agents are directed to evolve their capabilities under the watchful eye of a creative Context Engineer (CE), interesting behavior becomes emergent.  The Context Window (CW) of a modern LLM-based agentic AI assistant is a fundamental system constraint that must be curated carefully to produce the best possible results whether or not a human engineer is monitoring and correcting the automated development process. The recycling of the CW is handled differently by different systems, and it is that mechanism that guides the CE's methodology.  Systems like Claude Code and Gemini CLI use a Markdown formatted primary prompt - by convention CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md respectively - that we will hereafter refer to as a Preamble (as you will see the analogy to Constitutional Governance is apt) which is by default loaded into the CW after a System Prompt which is potentially obscured or customizable itself.  The Preamble is intended as a user customization entrypoint that strongly influences its behavior second only in influence to the System Prompt.  Indeed the Preamble can be edited by the agent, usually through a human developer's prompting, which is a recipe for an interesting feedback loop and methodology of directed AI system evolution (RESOLVE ClaudeLog attribution).   An agent's access to a local file system and command terminal allows the CE to offload structure
