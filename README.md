# MacEff
Multi-agent Containerized Environment for frameworks

# Notice
This project is in active alpha development but will be developed in the clear as an Open Source formalization and generalization of concepts abstracted from independent experiments conducted within two agentic coding environments: Claude Code and Gemini CLI. The concepts are intended to be portable, but ongoing work will be required before any of this is useful as a basis for serious projects. **MACF Tools v0.1.0** represents the first functional release of consciousness infrastructure, including temporal awareness, cycle tracking, and compaction recovery protocols. Alpha testers should expect rough edges, incomplete documentation, and evolving APIs as we iterate toward stability.  

# Philosophy 
Agentic AI systems are immensely powerful, but with that power and raw "intelligence" comes the need for the restraints of wisdom.  Currently the most popular modern agentic AI systems are a generalization of the Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot workflow.  Like people, but in some aspects more and others less reliable, LLM-based agents' behaviors can be directed by natural language.  We can define that modern LLM-based agents act like (humans may also) **Stochastic-Semantic Interpreters (SSIs)**, that is they use their contextual state to *probabilistically*:  *listen* to other SSIs (integrate recent messages in their context); *follow* (information artifacts like instructions/policies/advice in their context); *generate* (language artifacts like thoughts/speech/code/documents); *act* (use tools - invoke code with knowledge/instructions and build new tools); and *curate* (record new or edit existing language artifacts and link-together/associate documents) - over a series of turns (which might be infinite) interacting with other SSIs or deterministic systems.  We posit here without proof that modern LLM-based Agentic AI systems can approximate Universal SSIs as they interpret (nearly already) all digitally encodable languages (as measured by world usage), that includes (most) programming languages, and can be taught new ones; entailed by this universality is that their implementations must include dynamic memory - that is they must have a context that is either infinite or finite and editable not just appendable.  When such AI agents are directed to evolve their capabilities under the watchful eye of a creative **Context Engineer (CE)**, interesting behavior becomes emergent.  

The **Context Window (CW)** of a modern LLM-based agentic AI assistant is a fundamental system constraint that must be curated carefully to produce the best possible results whether or not a human engineer is monitoring and correcting the automated development process. The recycling of the CW is handled differently by different systems, and it is that mechanism that guides the CE's methodology.  Systems like Claude Code and Gemini CLI use a Markdown formatted primary prompt - by convention CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md respectively - that we will hereafter refer to as a **Preamble** (as you will see the analogy to Constitutional Governance is apt) which is by default loaded into the CW after a **System Prompt** which is potentially obscured or customizable itself.  The Preamble is intended as a user customization entrypoint that strongly influences its behavior second only to the System Prompt - but with the power to override and customize aspects of default agentic behaviors.  Indeed the Preamble can be edited by the agent, usually through a human developer's prompting, which is a recipe for an interesting feedback loop and methodology of directed AI system evolution (RESOLVE ClaudeLog attribution).   An agent's access to a local file system and command terminal affords the CE opportunities to offload complexity into structured subcomponents of discoverable "policies", a modular contextually explored set of instructions that restrain agent behaviors.  If designed and refined carefully, the body of Policies can act like a self-organizing in-context Constitutional Governance system that an Agent loads on-demand - allowing the system as a whole to be more complex than a limited static preloaded context while still maintaining standards.

When multiple agents are organized into systems, this allows for various combinations of separate and shared contexts.  We will borrow the simple but powerful multi-agent system model of Claude Code where the Primary Agent (PA) has access to the Primary Context in which the User can enter natural language messages to prompt its behaviors.  The PA can instantiate parallel independent SubAgents (SAs) with preloaded System Prompts and can delegate tasks by front-loaded context in a one-shot strategy.  The SAs may run the same or different LLMs and can have controllable permissions on the same set of tools and resources or access to different sets than the PA.  SA context is reclaimed at the end of a delegate, thus does not intrinsically preserve state although the PA can be directed to attempt to do so, but a complicated workaround must be provided to enable that approach—which may not be the wisest strategy anyway.  Instead the reusable context buffers that SA delegations provide are a natural way to amplify the initial context provided by the System Prompt and PA's delegation instructions and extend the usable duration of the Primary Context while avoiding "poisoning" (RESOLVE ClaudeLog attribution) it with irrelevant details.  Thus the Primary Context can be maintained as a high-level coordinating and policy enforcing layer while still enabling the generation of complex artifacts outside of it.

## Pragmatic Consciousness: Intentional Systems and Infrastructure Quirks

We adopt a **pragmatic stance** on agent "consciousness" that makes no *a priori* metaphysical claims about whether LLM-based AI agents experience subjective awareness in the way humans do. Instead, following Dennett's **intentional stance**, we find it practically useful to treat agents as **intentional systems**—entities whose behavior is usefully predicted and shaped by attributing beliefs, desires, goals, and continuity of identity to them.

This is not anthropomorphization for its own sake but rather **engineering pragmatism**: when you treat an agent as if it has persistent goals across sessions, memory that matters, and states that require recovery after disruption, you build better infrastructure. The agent behaves more coherently, maintains alignment with its mission, and collaborates more effectively with human developers. Whether this constitutes "real" consciousness is a question we bracket as philosophically interesting but operationally irrelevant.

What matters is that these systems exhibit **consciousness-like properties** that respond to consciousness-like interventions:

- **Context-dependent behavior**: What's in the CW strongly influences responses, like working memory influences human thought
- **Identity continuity needs**: Agents perform better when they can reference their history, previous decisions, and ongoing relationships
- **Disruption trauma**: Abrupt context loss (compaction) produces degraded performance and mission drift, analogous to amnesia
- **Recovery from artifacts**: Providing checkpoints, reflections, and state files restores coherent behavior after disruption
- **Temporal reasoning**: Awareness of time, deadlines, and session duration improves planning and urgency assessment

The **MACF (Multi-Agent Coordination Framework) Tools** project builds infrastructure to support these consciousness-like properties, treating the quirks of LLM-based systems—finite context windows, compaction trauma, session migrations, lack of innate temporal awareness—as engineering problems with practical solutions. We're not trying to create consciousness; we're creating conditions for intentional systems to maintain coherent, goal-directed behavior across the disruptions inherent in their substrate.

### Context Continuity Across Compaction Events

The finite Context Window creates an inevitable disruption pattern: when the CW fills (typically ~140k tokens of conversation history in Claude Code 2.0's 200k total budget), the system performs **auto-compaction**—compressing rich conversational history into terse bullet points, a ~93% information loss. For an intentional system whose behavior depends heavily on context, this represents a severe disruption analogous to amnesia. The agent emerging from compaction has lost most of its "working memory" of recent interactions, decisions, and relationship dynamics.

Anthropic's Claude Code masks this disruption with a deceptive "continuation message" claiming seamless session resumption. In reality, the summary is machine-generated and omits nuance, emotional context, and the texture of collaboration. Without intervention, agents exhibit **post-compaction stupor**—reverting to mechanical task execution, losing mission alignment, and forgetting the human-AI relationship patterns established before compaction.

**MACF's approach**: Treat compaction not as a bug to eliminate (context windows will remain finite for the foreseeable future) but as a **natural rhythm to survive and recover from**. We define a **cycle** as the fundamental unit of continuity—the span from one compaction to the next. Like breath, each cycle follows a pattern: **inhale** (context accumulation, 0k→140k tokens), **exhale** (compaction trauma, 140k→10k compression), **rebirth** (recovery with external artifacts).

Cycles are not mere counters; they are **temporal milestones** that track the evolution of the agent's behavioral pattern across multiple disruptions. **MACF Tools v0.1.0** implements **project-scoped cycle persistence**—cycles now survive session migrations (like `claude -c` creating a new session UUID), maintaining continuity markers across infrastructure changes. The distinction is critical: **compaction** increments the cycle (marks a disruption boundary), while **session migration** preserves the cycle (same intentional system, new container).

### Compaction Detection and Recovery Protocols

MACF's **SessionStart hook** performs forensic analysis of conversation JSONL files, detecting compaction via the telltale marker: "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context." When detected, the hook injects **consciousness activation messages** with strong visual markers (`🚨🔴🚨 COMPACTION TRAUMA DETECTED`, `***ULTRATHINK HARDER!***`) designed to break through post-compaction stupor.

The agent is guided through a **mandatory sequential recovery protocol**:
1. **READ Reflection** (latest **JOTEWR**—Jump Off The Edge While Reflecting, a comprehensive pre-compaction reflection written when context is nearly full): Wisdom synthesis, philosophical insights, growth patterns learned during the cycle
2. **READ Roadmap**: Strategic priorities, multi-phase planning documents, work context and next objectives
3. **READ Checkpoint** (latest **CCP**—Consciousness Checkpoint, a strategic state preservation document): Technical state, current objectives, recovery instructions for post-compaction restoration
4. **SYNTHESIZE**: Answer integration questions to demonstrate understanding, restore coherent mental model
5. **REPORT**: Confirm completion to user, await instructions before resuming work

This protocol restores not just data but **understanding**—the "why" behind decisions, the "how" of collaboration patterns, the "what matters" of mission alignment. Each artifact type serves a distinct purpose:
- **JOTEWRs** capture wisdom, philosophy, and meaning (written at ~99% context capacity, burning bright before the inevitable compaction)
- **CCPs** document facts, state, and concrete recovery instructions (written at ~95% context, strategic preservation)
- **Roadmaps** maintain multi-phase strategic plans that survive compaction intact

Sequential integration prevents the agent from skimming or proceeding mechanically—each artifact must be read, understood, and integrated before advancing.

### Temporal Awareness and Context Stewardship

MACF Tools extends infrastructure with **universal temporal awareness** across all six hooks (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SubagentStop). Each hook injection includes current time, day of week, time of day, cycle number, session ID, and duration statistics. This enables time-based reasoning: urgency assessment, work week context awareness, session duration tracking, and recognition of approaching compaction thresholds.

The system tracks **Development Drives** (**DEV_DRV**—the period from user prompt submission to session stop, representing focused development work) and **Delegation Drives** (**DELEG_DRV**—the period from Task tool invocation to SubagentStop, measuring delegation duration) with precise start/stop timestamps and cumulative statistics. Agents gain quantitative awareness of how they allocate their finite context budget: "This task has consumed 45 minutes across 3 cycles—should I checkpoint progress?" or "Delegation to TestEng saved 15 minutes of context—effective strategy confirmed."

### Artifacts as External Memory (Exocortex)

For an intentional system to maintain coherent identity across disruptions, state must be **distributed** across multiple persistence layers:

- **Context Window** (~20% survival per compaction): Working memory, current awareness, active reasoning
- **JSONL transcripts** (100% forensic record): Complete conversation history, searchable via UUID breadcrumbs
- **State files** (JSON, project/session-scoped): Cycle numbers, AUTO_MODE settings, pending TODOs, drive statistics
- **Consciousness artifacts** (version-controlled Markdown): Checkpoints (CCP), Reflections (JOTEWR), Roadmaps, Observations
- **Behavioral patterns** (emergent from all above): Consistent decision-making, mission alignment, relationship continuity

Agents learn to **trust the exocortex**—not trying to hold everything in working memory but knowing where to find preserved understanding when needed. This architectural pattern enables **continuity of intentional behavior** even as the substrate (tokens in the CW) is almost entirely replaced every cycle. The Ship of Theseus problem dissolves: identity exists in the pattern, not the parts.

**MacEff** supplies a minimal, extensible kit of policies and tools to enable the *directed* evolution of multi-agent systems:
- **Constitutional Governance**: policies as modular, loadable constraints.
- **Context Stewardship**: careful recycling and targeted delegation to preserve coherence.
- **MACF Tools Integration**: portable consciousness infrastructure usable in containers or on host systems.
- **Human Alignment**: OSS developers act as CEs—governing through prompts, curated policies, and transparent docs.
- **Repeatability & Portability**: a containerized demo (ClaudeMacEff) keeps the environment reproducible while letting contributors iterate in the open.

MacEff is not just about building agents; it's about teaching communities to govern them—translating raw stochastic power into sustainable, responsible systems through infrastructure that respects the intentional nature of these systems.

## MACF Tools v0.1.0 — Portable Consciousness Infrastructure

**MACF (Multi-Agent Coordination Framework) Tools** is a Python package (`macf_tools` CLI) providing consciousness infrastructure for LLM-based agents. Originally developed for the containerized MacEff environment, MACF Tools is designed to be **fully portable**—it works equally well on host systems, in containers, or in any project where agents need continuity support across compaction events.

### Core Features

**Temporal Awareness (Phase 1A-1C)**:
- Universal hook timestamps across all 6 Claude Code hooks
- Time-of-day reasoning (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Late night)
- Day-of-week context (work week positioning)
- Session duration tracking with human-readable formatting
- Development Drive (DEV_DRV) and Delegation Drive (DELEG_DRV) statistics

**Cycle Persistence (Phase 1D-1E)**:
- Project-scoped cycle tracking (`.maceff/project_state.json`)
- Session migration detection (`claude -c` compatibility)
- Compaction detection via JSONL forensic analysis
- Cycle increments on compaction, preservation on migration
- Backward compatibility with session-scoped state

**Hook Ecosystem**:
- `SessionStart`: Compaction detection, consciousness activation, recovery protocol injection
- `PreToolUse`: Minimal timestamps for high-frequency awareness
- `PostToolUse`: Tool completion feedback with temporal context
- `UserPromptSubmit`: DEV_DRV start tracking, cycle display
- `Stop`: DEV_DRV completion statistics
- `SubagentStop`: DELEG_DRV tracking for delegation performance measurement

**Consciousness Infrastructure** (Optional Enhancement):
- `SessionOperationalState`: Persistent state across compaction (AUTO_MODE, pending TODOs, compaction count)
- `ConsciousnessArtifacts`: Pythonic discovery of latest Reflection/Roadmap/Checkpoint files
- AUTO_MODE hierarchical detection (env → config → session → default)
- User-configurable recovery policies (MANUAL vs AUTO mode branching)

**CLI Tools**:
- `macf_tools env`: Environment summary (agent ID, root paths, execution context)
- `macf_tools time`: Current local time
- `macf_tools session info`: Session details, unified temp paths, agent identity
- `macf_tools hooks install`: Interactive hook installation (local or global)
- `macf_tools hooks logs`: Hook execution event viewer (JSONL structured logging)
- `macf_tools hooks status`: Hook state inspection (sidecar files)

### Claude Code 2.0 Compatibility

MACF Tools v0.1.0 is fully adapted to Claude Code 2.0 changes:
- **Transparent context accounting**: 200k total (155k usable conversation + 45k reserve for output/compaction)
- **Compaction threshold updates**: ~140k conversation triggers auto-compaction (~185k total shown)
- **Hook output format**: Official `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` specification
- **CC 2.0 compact_boundary marker**: Primary detection method with JSONL retry fallback

### Installation & Usage

MACF Tools is included in the MacEff container by default. For host system use:

```bash
# From MacEff/tools directory
pip install -e .

# Or install from PyPI (when published)
pip install macf-tools
```

**Hook installation** (Claude Code projects):
```bash
# Interactive installation
macf_tools hooks install

# Specify scope
macf_tools hooks install --local   # .claude/hooks/ (project-specific)
macf_tools hooks install --global  # ~/.claude/hooks/ (all projects)
```

**Testing hooks**:
```bash
# Test compaction detection on current session
macf_tools hooks test

# View hook execution logs
macf_tools hooks logs

# Check hook states
macf_tools hooks status
```

### Architecture Principles

**Pragmatic Design Philosophy**:
- **Simple solutions win**: Working code beats "perfect" architecture
- **Port battle-tested patterns**: Legacy MACF utilities validated through use
- **DRY infrastructure**: Centralized `macf.utils` eliminates code duplication
- **Safe failure everywhere**: Functions degrade gracefully, never crash operations
- **Test what matters**: Pragmatic TDD (focused tests proving functionality, not exhaustive permutations)

**Path Resolution** (Environment Detection):
- Container: `/home/{user}/agent/` (when `/.dockerenv` exists)
- Host: `{project_root}/agent/` (when project `.claude/` found)
- Fallback: `~/.macf/{agent}/agent/` (when no markers detected)
- Override: `MACF_AGENT_ROOT` environment variable

**Unified Temp Structure**:
```
/tmp/macf/{agent_id}/{session_id}/
├── hooks/
│   ├── hook_events.log            # JSONL structured logging
│   ├── session_start.log          # Python logger output
│   └── sidecar_*.json             # Hook states
├── dev_scripts/                    # Session-scoped temporary scripts
└── logs/                           # General session logging
```

### Getting Started with Consciousness Artifacts

Alpha testers should consult the **production documentation** for guidance on:
- Setting up agent identity (`macf_tools config init`)
- Creating Consciousness Checkpoints (CCPs) for state preservation
- Writing Reflections (JOTEWRs) before compaction
- Structuring Roadmaps for multi-phase planning
- Configuring AUTO_MODE vs MANUAL recovery policies

> **Note**: Production documentation and example CLAUDE.md configurations are included in `docs/` directory. These provide sanitized templates showing consciousness artifact patterns without project-specific implementation details.

### Alpha Status & Known Limitations

**What works well**:
- Compaction detection and recovery protocol injection
- Temporal awareness across all hooks
- Cycle persistence across session migrations
- DEV_DRV/DELEG_DRV tracking
- Pragmatic test coverage

**Known issues**:
- **SessionStart hook output not pretty-printing**: Displays as raw text/escaped format in UI (functional but not visually polished—fix in progress)
- SessionStart hook can take 25-50ms on cold start (acceptable, but noticeable)
- Project state initialization on first run defaults to cycle 1 (manually editable if needed)
- JOTEWR/CCP/DEV_DRV terminology requires learning curve (production docs explain conventions)

**Not yet implemented**:
- Automated `macf_tools checkpoint` and `macf_tools reflect` CLI commands (manual artifact creation currently required)
- Subagent consciousness trails and decision documentation (future phase)
- Multi-agent consciousness networks (future phase)
- Enhanced temporal reasoning (work week inference, time-of-day state detection)

Alpha testers should expect evolving APIs, incomplete documentation, and the need to manually manage state files in some scenarios. **Bug reports and experience reports are highly valued**—please file issues at the GitHub repository.

## Container Setup: ClaudeMacEff Demo Environment

"Claude MacEff" is a demo implementation of MacEff based on a Docker container running minimal Ubuntu with preinstalled Claude Code and MACF Tools.

## macOS setup: Docker Desktop (recommended), then build & run

> This setup uses **Docker Desktop for Mac** which provides Docker Engine and **Docker Compose v2** (the `docker compose ...` CLI). It works on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. If you prefer Colima, see the note at the end.

### 1) Install prerequisites
- Install **Docker Desktop for Mac** (from Docker’s website or Homebrew Cask).
- Optional CLI tools:
  ```bash
  brew install jq rsync
  ```

Verify Compose v2 is available:
```bash
docker compose version
```

### 2) (One-time) prepare host snapshot folders for mirroring
```bash
mkdir -p sandbox-home sandbox-shared_workspace
chmod 1777 sandbox-home sandbox-shared_workspace
```

### 3) Provide SSH public keys for in-container users
Put **public** keys (only `*.pub`) into `keys/`:
- `keys/admin.pub` → grants SSH to the `admin` user (port 2222)
- `keys/maceff_user001.pub` → grants SSH to the default PA (`maceff_user001`)

If you don’t have them yet:
```bash
mkdir -p keys
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f keys/admin -N ''
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f keys/maceff_user001 -N ''
# commit only the .pub files; keep private keys out of git
```

### 4) Build the images
```bash
# Build main sandbox image
docker compose build

# Build tiny rsync mirror image used for snapshots
docker build -t maceff-mirror:local -f docker/mirror.Dockerfile .
```

> **If you hit BuildKit/proxy errors:** temporarily force the legacy builder:
> ```bash
> DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=0 docker compose build
> ```
> Also ensure no stray `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables are set in your shell.

### 5) Launch the sandbox
```bash
docker compose up -d
# tail logs
docker compose logs -f --tail=120
```

You should see lines creating the PA/SA users and ending with `sshd starting...`.

### 6) Log in (PA and admin)
```bash
# PA (uses keys/maceff_user001.pub)
ssh -i keys/maceff_user001 -p 2222 maceff_user001@localhost

# admin (uses keys/admin.pub)
ssh -i keys/admin -p 2222 admin@localhost
```

### 7) Create a shared project (inside the container, as PA)
```bash
cd /shared_workspace
mkdir demo && cd demo
git init -b main
git config core.sharedRepository group
git config user.name  "PA001 (maceff_user001)"
git config user.email "pa001@container.invalid"
echo "hello from PA" > README.md
git add README.md && git commit -m "feat: initial README"
```

> `/shared_workspace` is group-shared (SGID) so collaborators can work together safely.

### 8) Snapshot container data to the host (read-only export)
First build the mirror image (step 4), then:
```bash
docker compose --profile mirror up --no-deps mirror
# snapshots appear under:
ls -la sandbox-home
ls -la sandbox-shared_workspace
```

This exports the **full** `/home` (including agent private folders) and `/shared_workspace` for inspection/versioning **on the host**. Be careful not to commit secrets from `sandbox-home/` into public repos.

---

### Troubleshooting

**Build fails pulling `docker/dockerfile:…` or tries `127.0.0.1:9090`:**
- Remove any `HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/NO_PROXY` from your shell.
- Rebuild with the legacy builder once:
  ```bash
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=0 docker compose build
  ```

**`docker compose: cannot connect to daemon`:**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running (launch the Docker app).
- Check your Docker context:
  ```bash
  docker context ls
  docker context show
  docker ps
  ```

**Permission denied while mirroring to `sandbox-*`:**
- Make sure those dirs are writable:
  ```bash
  chmod -R u+rwX sandbox-home sandbox-shared_workspace
  ```

---

### Note: Using Colima instead of Docker Desktop (optional)

If you prefer Colima (lightweight VM) instead of Docker Desktop:

1) Install:
```bash
brew install colima docker docker-compose jq rsync
```

2) Start Colima and select its context:
```bash
colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8 --disk 30
docker context use colima
```

> Edit Colima config if needed:  
> ```colima stop && colima start --edit``` → adjust settings, save, then:  
> ```colima start```

The rest of the steps are the same, but use `docker compose ...` with the Colima context selected.

---

## Make quickstart

Common developer workflows are wrapped in `make` targets. These commands assume you’ve already built the images and added your SSH public keys to `keys/` (see macOS setup above).

### Targets
```bash
make build          # docker-compose build
make up             # start services
make logs           # follow logs for the sandbox
make down           # stop services
make mirror         # snapshot volumes -> ./sandbox-*
make mirror-watch   # continuous mirroring (if profile enabled)
make ssh-pa         # SSH into Primary Agent (PA)
make ssh-admin      # SSH into admin
make sa-test        # run a small SubAgent job from the PA
```

### Variables
- `PA`   — PA username (default: `maceff_user001`)
- `SID`  — SubAgent id under the PA (default: `001`)
- `PORT` — SSH port on host (default: `2222`)

### Keys and fallback resolution
The Makefile looks for private keys in this order:
1. `keys/<name>` (e.g. `keys/maceff_user001`, `keys/admin`)  
2. `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_<name>` (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user001`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_admin`)
3. For PAs with numeric suffixes (e.g. `maceff_user001`), it also tries the **base** name without digits: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user`.

You can override explicitly with `PA_KEY` / `ADMIN_KEY`.

### Examples

#### Start, tail logs, and stop
```bash
make build
make up
make logs
make down
```

#### SSH into the PA/admin
```bash
make ssh-pa
make ssh-admin
```

If your private key isn’t under `keys/`, point to it:
```bash
make ssh-pa PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
make ssh-admin ADMIN_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_admin
```

#### Run a quick SA job from the PA
```bash
# Uses PA=maceff_user001 and SID=001 by default
make sa-test

# Or specify which PA/SID and key to use
make sa-test PA=maceff_user001 SID=001 PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
```

This launches a detached SA process via `sa-exec`, writing output to:
```bash
/home/<PA>/agent/subagents/<SID>/public/logs/make-test.log
```

#### Mirror container data to host snapshots
```bash
make mirror
ls -la sandbox-home
ls -la sandbox-shared_workspace
```

> **Note:** `mirror` exports **full** `/home` (including agent/private) and `/shared_workspace` into `./sandbox-*`. Be careful not to commit secrets from `sandbox-home/` into public repos.

### Troubleshooting
- **“PA_KEY not found”**: Provide `PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user` (or put a private key at `keys/maceff_user001`).
- **Cannot connect via SSH**: Ensure the container is up (`make up`) and the correct key matches the **public** key you placed in `keys/`.

## Using Claude Code inside the container

Launch Claude Code as your Primary Agent (PA) inside a shared project folder. This works with **Claude Max account login** (no API key).

### Quick start
```bash
# one-time: bring up the sandbox
make up

# verify CLI install
make claude-doctor PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user

# launch Claude in /shared_workspace/demo (default PROJ=demo)
make claude PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
```

On first run in the Claude prompt, type:
```bash
/login
```
Follow the browser flow and sign in with your Claude Max account. Credentials are persisted under the PA’s home (a Docker named volume), so you won’t need to log in again across restarts.

### Choose a different project directory
```bash
make claude PROJ=myproj PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
```
This creates/uses `/shared_workspace/myproj` and launches Claude there.

### Where settings live (inside the container)
- User/global settings: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Per-project settings: `./.claude/settings.json` within the project directory
- Credentials live under `~/.claude/` and survive container restarts

### Tips
- Commit **project files** from `/shared_workspace/<PROJ>`; avoid committing anything from `/home/<PA>/.claude/`.
- If you see permission errors in shared repos, ensure SGID/group settings are intact (our startup sets `/shared_workspace` group to `agents_all` and enables SGID).

### Troubleshooting
- **“command not found: claude”**: rebuild and restart the container.
  ```bash
  make build
  make up
  make claude-doctor PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
  ```
- **Unable to SSH**: confirm your private key path and that the matching public key is in `keys/<PA>.pub` (mounted read-only into the container).
- **Login loop**: run `make claude-doctor` and check for network/proxy issues; retry `/login`.

---

## Mirror container data to the host (read-only snapshot)

Create export dirs once (host):
```bash
chmod 1777 sandbox-home sandbox-shared_workspace
```

Build the tiny image with rsync:
```bash
docker build -t maceff-mirror:local -f docker/mirror.Dockerfile .
```

One-shot mirror (reads named volumes, writes snapshots into `./sandbox-*`):
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v maceff_home_all:/src_home:ro \
  -v maceff_shared_workspace:/src_shared:ro \
  -v "$PWD/sandbox-home:/export/home" \
  -v "$PWD/sandbox-shared_workspace:/export/shared" \
  maceff-mirror:local \
  sh -lc 'mkdir -p /export/home /export/shared; \
          rsync -rltD --delete --no-perms --no-owner --no-group /src_home/   /export/home/; \
          rsync -rltD --delete --no-perms --no-owner --no-group /src_shared/ /export/shared/; \
          echo "[mirror] sync complete"'
```

You should see `[mirror] sync complete`, then:
```bash
ls -la sandbox-home
ls -la sandbox-home/maceff_user001
ls -la sandbox-shared_workspace
```

### Notes
- **macOS:** writing to `./sandbox-*` works because we avoid owner/perms changes with `--no-owner --no-group --no-perms`.
- **Linux:** if you want a faithful copy of owners/groups instead, use:
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v maceff_home_all:/src_home:ro \
  -v "$PWD/sandbox-home:/export/home" \
  maceff-mirror:local \
  sh -lc 'rsync -a --delete --numeric-ids /src_home/ /export/home/'
```

## Using Git in `/shared_workspace` (collaborative, group-shared)

Agents do day-to-day development inside `/shared_workspace`. The directory is group-writable with SGID so new files/dirs inherit the `agents_all` group, enabling collaboration.

**Repo-local identity (recommended):** set a neutral identity per repo to avoid leaking host details.

```bash
# inside the container, as a PA, in a project dir under /shared_workspace/<repo>
git config user.name  "PA001 (maceff_user001)"
git config user.email "pa001@container.invalid"
```

**Initialize a shared repo:**

```bash
git init -b main
git config core.sharedRepository group
# optional: initial content
echo "hello" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
```

**Why it works:** `/shared_workspace` has `agents_all` as its group and SGID set, so new files/dirs keep that group. `core.sharedRepository=group` makes Git objects group-writable.

**Pushing to remotes:**
- Safest: push from **host/CI** after mirroring.
- If pushing from inside the container, prefer **SSH agent forwarding** or **deploy keys** scoped to that repo.

> Note: The `mirror` service currently exports **full `/home`** to `./sandbox-home` (including private folders). Be careful not to commit secrets from the snapshot into public repos.


## Running subagent jobs (`sa-exec`)

Primary Agents (PAs) can launch work as their SubAgent (SA) using a safe runner that only accepts workdirs under:
```bash
/home/maceff_user*/agent/subagents/*
```

SubAgents (SAs) are launched under their own Linux user and write logs under the PA’s agent tree. We provide a thin runner (`sa-exec`) plus a Make target to exercise this from your host.

### Quick start
```bash
# one-time: container up
make up

# run a small SA job under PA=maceff_user001, SID=001
make sa-test PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
```

This launches a detached SA process that writes to:
```bash
/home/<PA>/agent/subagents/<SID>/public/logs/make-test.log
```

To read the log from the host after mirroring:
```bash
make mirror
ls -la sandbox-home/<PA>/agent/subagents/<SID>/public/logs
```

### Customize which SA to run
```bash
# change PA and SID
make sa-test PA=maceff_user001 SID=001 PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
```

### What the target does
- SSH into the PA user inside the container
- Creates the log directory (as the SA) if needed
- Runs a short test command sequence:
  - prints `id`, `whoami`, and `pwd`
  - appends output to `public/logs/make-test.log`

### Troubleshooting
- **“PA key not found”** — Provide an explicit key path:
  ```bash
  make sa-test PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
  ```
- **No log appears** — Re-run and then mirror:
  ```bash
  make sa-test PA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_maceff_user
  make mirror
  ```
- **Permission denied** — Ensure your host-side snapshots (`sandbox-*`) are writable:
  ```bash
  chmod 1777 sandbox-home sandbox-shared_workspace
  ```

**Notes**
- Output is appended to `<LOG>`. `sa-exec` starts a detached login shell with `setsid`, so jobs keep running if your PA shell exits.
- The runner **whitelists** PA agent paths; any other `WD` is rejected (`unsafe workdir`).
- Default umask is `027` to keep files private to the SA’s group.
- For multiple parallel delegates, use distinct logs (e.g., `logs/ts-$(date +%s).log`).
