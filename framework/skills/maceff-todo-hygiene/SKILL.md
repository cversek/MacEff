## Policy Engagement Protocol

Navigate `framework/policies/base/development/todo_hygiene.md` using CEP navigation:

1. **First access**: Read from beginning to `=== CEP_NAV_BOUNDARY ===` marker
2. **Identify relevant sections**: Based on your planned action (adding, modifying, completing, removing)
3. **Selective read**: Read only sections relevant to your current action using offset/limit

## Questions to Extract from Policy (Action-Oriented)

**Before Adding Items:**
1. What structure requirements apply when adding new TODOs?
2. What format requirements apply to new TODO items?

**Before Modifying Items:**
3. What preservation requirements apply when editing existing TODOs?
4. What context must be maintained when reorganizing?

**Before Marking Complete:**
5. What verification is required before marking a TODO complete?
6. What must be added to completed items for traceability?

**Before Removing/Collapsing Items:**
7. What must happen before removing or collapsing completed work?
8. What are the requirements for reducing TODO hierarchy depth?

**General:**
9. What documentation integration requirements exist for TODOs?
10. What backup requirements apply to significant TODO modifications?

## Execution

1. **Identify your action type**: Adding, modifying, completing, or removing
2. **Read relevant policy sections** using CEP navigation
3. **Extract requirements** for your specific action
4. **Apply requirements** to your planned TodoWrite operation

## Critical Meta-Pattern

**Policy as API**: Questions ask WHAT requirements exist, not HOW to implement them. The policy provides implementation details; this skill ensures you consult it.
