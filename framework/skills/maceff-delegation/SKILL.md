Prepare effective delegation to MacEff subagents by reading policy to understand current delegation architecture and constraints.

---

## Policy Engagement Protocol

**Read MacEff framework policies to understand delegation patterns**:

1. `framework/policies/base/delegation_guidelines.md` - Complete delegation architecture
2. `framework/policies/base/meta/subagent_definition.md` (§2-3) - Reading-list patterns

## Questions to Extract from Policy Reading

After reading policies, extract answers to:

1. **Delegation Decision Framework** - What determines when delegation is appropriate vs inappropriate?
2. **Information Architecture** - What information must specialists receive? How should it be provided?
3. **Authority Mechanisms** - How are decision-making permissions handled?
4. **Deliverables Structure** - What artifacts do specialists produce? Where?
5. **Success Definition** - How should completion criteria be specified?
6. **Constraint Communication** - What limitations must specialists understand?
7. **Execution Architecture** - What are the specialist capabilities and limitations?
8. **Validation Protocols** - How should results be verified post-delegation?

## Execution

Apply patterns discovered from policy reading to current delegation context.

## Critical Meta-Pattern

**Policy as API**: This skill points to policies without encoding their current contents. As delegation practices evolve, policy updates automatically update behavior without skill changes.
