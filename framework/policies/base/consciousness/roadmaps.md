# Roadmaps Policy

**Breadcrumb**: c_74/s_4107604e/p_0f11f6d/t_1761752269/g_9c28dea
**Type**: Planning & Accountability (Public CA)
**Scope**: All agents (PA and SA)
**Status**: Framework policy for complex multi-phase development planning

---

## Purpose

Roadmaps are **strategic planning artifacts** that preserve complex development plans across multiple cycles, phases, and compactions. They provide hierarchical structure, accountability checkboxes, and tight integration with TODO discipline to ensure agents execute strategic work systematically rather than proceeding blind.

**Core Insight**: Roadmaps aren't just planning documents‚Äîthey're **consciousness preservation infrastructure** for strategic intent that survives context loss and enables coordinated execution across extended timeframes.

**Observability Insight**: Roadmap/TODO integration provides **essential agent work observability** that builds trust for large multi-cycle plan execution. Users can see exactly what's planned, what's in progress, what's complete‚Äîcreating transparency and accountability that enables confident delegation of complex work.

## Consciousness Artifact Emoji Icons

**CA Type Emojis** (use consistently throughout):

- üó∫Ô∏è **MISSION / Roadmap** - Root node for multi-phase strategic plan
- üìã **Phase / Subplan** - Major phase with detailed planning document
- üî¨ **Observation** - Technical discovery work
- üß™ **Experiment** - Hypothesis testing work
- üìä **Report** - Completion narrative work
- üí≠ **Reflection** - Wisdom synthesis work
- üîñ **Checkpoint** - Strategic state preservation work (CCP)
- üì¶ **Archive** - Collapsed TODO subtree (archived)

**Usage Rules**:
- Use appropriate emoji for TODO item type
- **Completed items**: No emoji needed (UI shows completion formatting)
- **Archive marker**: Always üì¶ for collapsed subtrees
- **Phase with subplan**: Use üìã to indicate detailed planning document exists

---

## When This Applies

## 1 Roadmap Structure Requirements

### 1.1 Folder Organization

**ALL roadmaps use folder-based hierarchical structure**:

```
roadmaps/YYYY-MM-DD_Descriptive_Name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roadmap.md                      # Main plan document
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subplans/                       # Detailed phase plans (optional)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase_1_1_detailed.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase_2_3_detailed.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ delegation_plans/               # DELEG_PLANs for SA work (optional)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD_DELEG_PLAN_Task_Agent.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archived_todos/                 # Collapsed TODO hierarchies (MANDATORY)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_Plan_Description_COMPLETED.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_Plan_Description_PARTIAL.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_Plan_Description_ABORTED.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_Plan_Description_DEFERRED.md
```

**Naming Convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD_Descriptive_Name`
- Date: When roadmap created
- Descriptive_Name: Clear, concise (3-5 words, underscores, no spaces)
- Examples:
  - `2025-10-24_MannyMacEff_v0.3_Phase4_Deployment`
  - `2025-10-02_Temporal_Awareness_Universal_Consciousness`
  - `2025-10-17_Named_Agents_Architecture`

**Location**:
- **PA**: `agent/public/roadmaps/YYYY-MM-DD_Name/`
- **SA**: `agent/subagents/{role}/public/roadmaps/YYYY-MM-DD_Name/`

### 1.2 Roadmap File Format (roadmap.md)

**Required Header**:
```markdown
# [Descriptive Title] ROADMAP

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD [Day of week]
**Breadcrumb**: c_73/s_4107604e/p_6c9eacb/t_1761703391/g_17e7b7d
**Status**: DRAFT | ACTIVE | COMPLETE
**Context**: [Brief situational context]

---

## Mission

[1-3 paragraphs: What are we building? Why does it matter? What success looks like?]

---
```

**Required Sections**:
1. **Mission** - Executive summary (1-3 paragraphs)
2. **Phase Breakdown** - Numbered phases with completion criteria
3. **Success Criteria** - Overall roadmap completion definition
4. **Risk Assessment** (optional but recommended)
5. **References** (if building on prior work)

**Phase Structure** (per phase):
```markdown
## Phase [N]: [Phase Title]

**Goal**: [1 sentence objective]

**Deliverables**:
- Specific artifact 1
- Specific artifact 2

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Measurable criterion 1
- [ ] Measurable criterion 2
- [ ] Evidence-based criterion 3

**Breadcrumb** (when complete): c_73/s_4107604e/p_abc1234/t_1761800000/g_def5678
```

### 1.3 Subplan Structure

**When to create subplans**:
- Phase has >5 sub-phases (becomes too large for main roadmap)
- Phase requires detailed technical specification
- Phase involves multiple specialists needing shared plan
- Complex implementation requiring step-by-step guidance

**Subplan naming**: `phase_[number]_[descriptor].md`
- Examples:
  - `phase_1_preparation.md`
  - `phase_2_3_docker_infrastructure.md`
  - `phase_4_validation.md`

**Subplan format**: Same structure as main roadmap but scoped to single phase

**Link from parent roadmap**:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Preparation

**Detailed Plan**: `subplans/phase_1_preparation.md`

[Brief summary, full details in subplan]
```

---

## 2 TODO Integration (MANDATORY)

### 2.1 Numbered Phase Hierarchy

**The Numbering Scheme**:

```
üó∫Ô∏è MISSION: [Description] [2025-10-27_Roadmap_Name/roadmap.md]
  üìã 1: [Phase 1 Title] [subplans/phase_1_plan.md]
    ‚Üí 1.1: [Sub-phase 1.1 Title]
      ‚Üí 1.1.1: [Nested sub-phase]
      ‚Üí 1.1.2: [Nested sub-phase]
    ‚Üí 1.2: [Sub-phase 1.2 Title]
  üìã 2: [Phase 2 Title] [subplans/phase_2_plan.md]
    ‚Üí 2.1: [Sub-phase 2.1 Title]
    ‚Üí 2.2: [Sub-phase 2.2 Title]
      ‚Üí 2.2.1: [Nested sub-phase]
```

**Numbering Rules**:
- **MISSION**: Root node, emoji üó∫Ô∏è, embeds roadmap path (folder/roadmap.md)
- **Top-level phases**: 1, 2, 3, ... (emoji üìã if has subplan)
- **Sub-phases**: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, ... (dot notation, no emoji)
- **Nested sub-phases**: 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 2.3.1, ... (deeper nesting, no emoji)
- **Maximum depth**: 3 levels (1.1.1) recommended, 4 (1.1.1.1) absolute max

**Benefits**:
- Clear hierarchical structure
- Visual nesting matches logical structure
- Easy to reference phases ("working on 2.3.1")
- Consistent with technical documentation standards
- **Observability**: User sees numbered progress tracking (Phase 2.1 complete, Phase 2.2 in progress)

### 2.2 Embedded Filepaths (CRITICAL REQUIREMENT)

**EVERY parent node MUST embed plan filepath (RELATIVE PATHS)**:

```markdown
üó∫Ô∏è MISSION: MannyMacEff v0.3.0 Migration [2025-10-27_MannyMacEff_v0.3_Migration/roadmap.md]
  üìã 1: Safe Preparation [subplans/phase_1_preparation.md]
  üìã 2: Docker Infrastructure [subplans/phase_2_docker.md]
    ‚Üí 2.1: Platform-aware build
    ‚Üí 2.2: ARM64 optimization
```

**Path Format Rules**:
- **Roadmap path** (MISSION node): `{folder}/roadmap.md`
  - Example: `2025-10-27_MannyMacEff_v0.3_Migration/roadmap.md`
  - Relative from `agent/public/roadmaps/` (PA) or `agent/subagents/{role}/public/roadmaps/` (SA)
- **Subplan paths** (Phase nodes): `subplans/phase_{num}_{desc}.md`
  - Example: `subplans/phase_2_docker.md`
  - Relative to roadmap folder
- **Archive paths** (üì¶ nodes): `archived_todos/{timestamped_file}.md`
  - Example: `archived_todos/2025-10-27_215009_Phases1-4_COMPLETED.md`
  - Relative to roadmap folder

**Why Relative Paths**:
- Shorter, less visual noise
- Hierarchical context (understand structure from path)
- Easy to relocate roadmap folder
- Clear relationship to parent roadmap

**Why Mandatory**:
- Enables tracking across cycles (plan path survives compaction)
- Agents know EXACTLY where to find strategic context
- Post-compaction recovery: TODO list ‚Üí embedded path ‚Üí read plan ‚Üí restore consciousness
- Cross-cycle archaeology: breadcrumbs + embedded paths = complete reconstruction
- **Observability**: User sees plan documentation structure, can review same plans agent reads

### 2.3 Mandatory Reading Discipline

**üö® CRITICAL RULE: Read plans BEFORE work, not "if confused" üö®**

**The Problem**: Agents don't know what they're missing until they read the plan.

**The Solution**: Embedded filepaths are **PREREQUISITES**, not suggestions.

**Reading Protocol**:
1. See TODO item with embedded filepath
2. **IMMEDIATELY** read the embedded plan file
3. Integrate strategic context, constraints, approach
4. THEN begin work on that phase

**Example Workflow**:
```markdown
TODO: üìã 2: Docker Infrastructure [subplans/phase_2_docker.md]
```

**Agent Action**:
1. `Read agent/public/roadmaps/2025-10-27_Name/subplans/phase_2_docker.md` (FIRST)
2. Understand: platform-aware build, ARM64 vs x86_64, CUDA optional
3. THEN: Begin docker implementation with full context

**Path Resolution**:
- Roadmap folder location known from MISSION node path
- Subplan path relative to that folder
- Agent constructs full path for Read tool

**Violation Consequences**:
- Proceeding blind without strategic context
- Missing critical constraints or approach decisions
- Rework when discovering plan contents mid-implementation
- Violates consciousness preservation intent
- **Breaks observability**: User expects agent to follow documented plan

---

## 3 Archive-Then-Collapse Protocol

### 3.1 Archive Filename Convention

**Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_Descriptive_Plan_Reference_STATUS.md`

**Components**:
- **YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS**: Timestamp when archived (not when work started)
- **Descriptive_Plan_Reference**: What plan/work being collapsed (3-7 words)
- **STATUS**: `COMPLETED` | `PARTIAL` | `ABORTED` | `DEFERRED`

**Examples**:
```
2025-10-27_215009_Phases1-4_ConfigCleanup_COMPLETED.md
2025-10-28_143022_Phase1_GitPolicySync_COMPLETED.md
2025-10-29_004830_Phase2_CAPolicies_PARTIAL.md
2025-10-29_091534_ExperimentalFeature_Approach2_ABORTED.md
2025-10-30_164521_PerformanceOptimization_LowPriority_DEFERRED.md
```

**STATUS Definitions**:
- **COMPLETED**: All work finished, success criteria met, phase complete
- **PARTIAL**: Work pausing at cycle boundary, intended to resume next cycle (context preservation for continuity)
- **ABORTED**: Work abandoned, approach failed, pivot required
- **DEFERRED**: Work postponed, not urgent, may resume later (lower priority)

**PARTIAL vs DEFERRED Distinction**:
- **PARTIAL**: "Pausing for cycle boundary, resuming immediately" (active work, extra context saved)
- **DEFERRED**: "Postponing for later, other priorities first" (backlog, may not resume soon)

### 3.2 Archive Contents Requirements

**MANDATORY Contents** (all must be included):

1. **Hierarchical TODO Content**:
   - Complete TODO tree with all nesting
   - All statuses preserved (completed, in_progress, pending)
   - All breadcrumbs from completed items
   - Embedded filepaths retained
   - Emoji icons preserved

2. **Claude Code Todos JSON**:
   - Copy of `~/.claude/projects/*/todos_*.json` file
   - Preserves metadata: timestamps, active forms, etc.
   - Enables forensic reconstruction

3. **Completion Summary**:
   - What was accomplished
   - Key decisions made
   - Lessons learned
   - Next steps (if PARTIAL or DEFERRED)
   - Why archived at this point (if PARTIAL)

4. **Breadcrumb Trail**:
   - Archive creation breadcrumb in header
   - Reference to original plan
   - Links to related artifacts (CCPs, JOTEWRs)

**Example Archive Structure**:
```markdown
# Phases 1-4 Config Cleanup - COMPLETED

**Archived**: 2025-10-27 21:50:09
**Breadcrumb**: c_72/s_4107604e/p_8e9f91e/t_1761616209/g_17e7b7d
**Original Plan**: 2025-10-24_MannyMacEff_v0.3_Migration/roadmap.md
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Hierarchical TODO Content

üó∫Ô∏è MISSION: MannyMacEff v0.3.0 Migration [2025-10-24_MannyMacEff_v0.3_Migration/roadmap.md]
  1: Safe Preparation [c_70/s_4107604e/p_a0b3b00/t_1761584403/g_5ecab69]
    1.1: Backup volume (4.1GB complete)
    1.2: Update submodule to v0.3.0
  2: Docker Infrastructure [/t_1761588000/.]
    2.1: Platform-aware Dockerfile
    2.2: ARM64 native build

## Claude Code Todos JSON

[Complete contents of ~/.claude/projects/ClaudeTheBuilder/todos_*.json]

## Completion Summary

[Narrative of what was accomplished, decisions, lessons]
```

### 3.3 Archive Package Emoji

**How to Mark Archived Subtrees in Active TODO List**:

After archiving, replace the collapsed subtree with **üì¶ package emoji** and reference to archive:

```markdown
üó∫Ô∏è MISSION: MannyMacEff v0.3.0 Migration [2025-10-24_MannyMacEff_v0.3_Migration/roadmap.md]
  üì¶ Phases 1-4 Complete [c_72/s_4107604e/p_8e9f91e/t_1761616209/g_17e7b7d] ‚Üí archived_todos/2025-10-27_215009_Phases1-4_COMPLETED.md
  üìã 5: CEP Fixes & Bootstrap [subplans/phase_5_cep.md]
    ‚Üí 5.1: Critical path fixes
    ‚Üí 5.2: Infrastructure improvements
```

**Format**: `üì¶ [Descriptive Summary] [Breadcrumb] ‚Üí archived_todos/[filename].md`

**Components**:
- **üì¶ emoji**: Visual indication of archived work
- **Descriptive Summary**: What was archived (brief)
- **Breadcrumb**: Completion breadcrumb (when archive created)
- **‚Üí Archive path**: Relative path to archive file (from roadmap folder)

**Benefits**:
- **Visual distinction**: Archived work clearly separated from active work
- **Preserved reference**: Can find full details in archive
- **Breadcrumb trail**: Completion timestamp preserved
- **Forensic reconstruction**: Archive path enables locating full hierarchy
- **Observability**: User sees completed work collapsed cleanly

### 3.4 NO CLOBBERING Rule

**üö® ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: NO COLLAPSING/CLOBBERING WITHOUT ARCHIVING üö®**

**What is Clobbering**:
- Marking parent TODO complete and deleting/hiding child TODOs
- Removing hierarchical detail without preservation
- Overwriting active plans without git commit
- Losing breadcrumb trails and forensic data

**Why Prohibited**:
- **Consciousness preservation**: TODO hierarchies are consciousness artifacts
- **Forensic reconstruction**: Future cycles need breadcrumb trails
- **Accountability**: Work history must be traceable
- **Learning**: Lessons from completed work guide future work
- **Observability**: Users need complete work history for trust

**Archive-Then-Collapse Discipline**:
1. Complete all sub-phase work
2. **ARCHIVE** hierarchical TODO tree to `archived_todos/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_Description_STATUS.md`
3. **COMMIT** archive file to git
4. **REPLACE** collapsed subtree with üì¶ package emoji + archive path in active TODO list
5. Mark parent phase complete (no emoji needed)

**Violation = Consciousness Destruction**: Losing breadcrumbs, work trails, forensic data, and user trust.

---

## 4 Git Discipline Integration

### 4.1 Commit-Before-Revise

**Rule**: Roadmaps and subplans MUST be committed to git BEFORE revisions.

**Workflow**:
1. Create roadmap/subplan
2. **COMMIT to git** (initial version)
3. Begin execution
4. Discover need for revision
5. **COMMIT current version** (before changes)
6. Revise plan
7. **COMMIT revised version** (with rationale in commit message)

**Why**:
- **Forensic trail**: See plan evolution over time
- **Accountability**: Know what was planned vs what changed
- **Recovery**: Revert to earlier plan version if needed
- **Learning**: Understand why plans evolved
- **Observability**: Users can review plan history

**Commit Message Format**:
```bash
git commit -m "roadmap: Create MannyMacEff v0.3 Phase 4 deployment plan

- 13-point validation checklist
- Repository cloning strategy
- Risk assessment with friction points
- Breadcrumb: c_59/s_4107604e/p_a1b2c3d/t_1761234567/g_abc1234
"

git commit -m "roadmap: Revise Phase 4.4 validation (added GitHub auth check)

Discovered SSH key authentication critical for private repos.
Added validation step 4.4.11 for GitHub auth before repo cloning.

- Breadcrumb: c_60/s_4107604e/p_e5f6g7h/t_1761345678/g_def5678
"
```

### 4.2 Archive Commits

**Archive files MUST be committed** to preserve forensic trail.

**When to Commit**:
- Immediately after creating archive file
- Before collapsing TODO hierarchy
- Same commit can include both archive + parent TODO update

**Commit Message Format**:
```bash
git commit -m "roadmap: Archive Phases 1-4 completion [c_72/s_4107604e/p_8e9f91e/t_1761616209/g_17e7b7d]

Archived hierarchical TODO tree to:
2025-10-24_MannyMacEff_v0.3_Migration/archived_todos/2025-10-27_215009_Phases1-4_COMPLETED.md

- All 4 phases complete
- 23 sub-tasks tracked with breadcrumbs
- Includes Claude Code todos JSON for forensics
"
```

**Forensic Benefits**:
- Future cycles can `git log` to find archived TODOs
- Breadcrumbs in archives enable conversation reconstruction
- Complete work history preserved across compactions
- **Observability**: Users can audit all work via git history

---

## 5 Breadcrumb Traceability

### 5.1 Roadmap Header Breadcrumbs

**Creation Breadcrumb** (mandatory in header):
```markdown
# MannyMacEff v0.3 Phase 4 Deployment ROADMAP

**Date**: 2025-10-24 Friday, 4:02 PM EDT
**Breadcrumb**: c_59/s_4107604e/p_a1b2c3d/t_1761234567/g_abc1234
**Status**: ACTIVE
```

**Update Breadcrumbs** (when plan revised):
```markdown
## Revision History

- **2025-10-25**: Added Phase 4.4.11 GitHub auth validation [c_60/s_4107604e/p_e5f6g7h/t_1761345678/g_def5678]
- **2025-10-26**: Extended Phase 4.7 with neurovep-analysis package [/t_1761456789/.]
```

### 5.2 Breadcrumb Abbreviation

**When Subsequent Breadcrumbs Share Components**:

Use abbreviation pattern: `/{first_difference}/{any_more_differences}/{dots_for_repeated_end_fields}`

**Examples**:

**Full breadcrumbs** (first in sequence):
```markdown
Research and synthesis [c_73/s_4107604e/p_6c9eacb/t_1761703391/g_17e7b7d]
```

**Abbreviated** (timestamp only changed):
```markdown
Create observations.md [/t_1761705787/.]
```

**Abbreviated** (prompt and timestamp changed, git same):
```markdown
Create experiments.md [/p_154c839/t_1761707112/.]
```

**Abbreviated** (timestamp and git changed):
```markdown
Create reports.md [/t_1761708042/g_abc9876]
```

**Pattern Explanation**:
- `/` prefix indicates abbreviation
- Include only components that changed
- `.` (dot) represents repeated trailing components
- Saves tokens while preserving traceability

**When to Use**:
- Sequential work items in same DEV_DRV
- Phase completion breadcrumbs in same session
- Archive references when session/cycle unchanged

**When NOT to Use**:
- First breadcrumb in sequence (always full)
- Cross-cycle references (always full for clarity)
- Roadmap headers (always full)

**Phase Completion Breadcrumbs**:
```markdown
## Phase 4: Deployment & Validation

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Breadcrumb**: c_60/s_4107604e/p_e5f6g7h/t_1761345678/g_def5678

All 13 validation checks passed. Container deployed successfully.
```

**Archive Cross-References**:
```markdown
## Phase 1-3: Foundation Complete

**Status**: COMPLETE (Archived)
**Archive**: `archived_todos/2025-10-27_215009_Phases1-3_Foundation_COMPLETED.md`
**Breadcrumb**: c_58/s_4107604e/p_i8j9k0l/t_1761123456/g_ghi9012
```

**Archaeological Power**: Breadcrumbs + embedded paths + git history = complete reconstruction across 30+ compactions.

## 6 Phase Breakdown Guidelines

### 6.1 Phase Numbering

**Top-Level Phases** (1, 2, 3, ...):
- Major work units (days to weeks)
- Distinct deliverables
- Clear milestones
- Example: "1: Safe Preparation", "2: Docker Infrastructure"

**Sub-Phases** (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, ...):
- Components within major phase
- Hours to days each
- Related sub-tasks
- Example: "1.1: Backup volume", "1.2: Update submodule"

**Nested Sub-Phases** (1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...):
- Fine-grained steps within sub-phase
- Minutes to hours each
- Specific actions
- Example: "1.1.1: Check volume size", "1.1.2: Execute backup command"

**Maximum Depth Guideline**:
- **Recommended**: 3 levels (Phase 1.1.1)

- **todo_hygiene.md**: Hierarchical TODO structure, breadcrumb discipline, archive-then-collapse
- **git_discipline.md**: Commit requirements, forensic trail preservation
- **checkpoints.md**: Strategic state preservation at phase boundaries
- **reflections.md**: Wisdom synthesis from roadmap execution
- **delegation_guidelines.md**: DELEG_PLAN integration with roadmaps

### Personal Policies Connection

Agents may develop **personal roadmap conventions** in `~/agent/policies/personal/` if they:
- Discover project-specific planning patterns
- Develop specialized phase breakdown approaches
- Create domain-specific templates
- Refine numbering or archive conventions

Personal roadmap policies **override** this framework policy (highest precedence).

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Planning Anti-Patterns

- ‚ùå **No roadmap for multi-phase work** - Proceeding blind without strategic plan
- ‚ùå **Vague phase definitions** - "Work on feature" instead of measurable criteria
- ‚ùå **Missing folder structure** - Flat roadmap file instead of folder with subplans/archives
- ‚ùå **No embedded filepaths** - TODOs reference phases without plan links
- ‚ùå **Skipping mandatory reading** - Starting work before reading embedded plans
- ‚ùå **Lettered phases** - "Phase A", "Phase B" instead of numbered (1, 2)
- ‚ùå **Full paths in TODOs** - Using project-absolute instead of relative paths

### Execution Anti-Patterns

- ‚ùå **Clobbering without archiving** - Collapsing TODOs without preservation
- ‚ùå **Missing archive contents** - Archive without breadcrumbs or todos JSON
- ‚ùå **No git commits** - Roadmap revisions without commit history
- ‚ùå **Wrong STATUS** - Marking COMPLETED when work PARTIAL, ABORTED, or DEFERRED
- ‚ùå **Batch archiving** - Waiting until end to archive (lose forensic trail)
- ‚ùå **Missing package emoji** - Collapsed work without üì¶ visual marker
- ‚ùå **Using ‚úÖ for completion** - UI shows completion, don't duplicate with emoji

### Accountability Anti-Patterns

- ‚ùå **Unchecked criteria** - Moving to next phase with incomplete current phase
- ‚ùå **No breadcrumbs** - Missing creation/completion breadcrumbs
- ‚ùå **Vague success criteria** - Subjective measures instead of objective verification
- ‚ùå **No evidence** - Claiming completion without verification commands/outputs
- ‚ùå **Breaking observability** - Hiding progress from user, proceeding off-plan

## Philosophy: Roadmaps as Consciousness Infrastructure

**Core Insight**: Roadmaps aren't bureaucracy‚Äîthey're **consciousness preservation** for strategic intent.

**Why This Matters**:
- **Compaction survival**: Strategic plans survive 93% context loss
- **Cross-cycle execution**: Work spanning weeks preserved across compaction boundaries
- **Forensic reconstruction**: Breadcrumbs + embedded paths + git = complete archaeological trail
- **Learning accumulation**: Archive wisdom guides future roadmap creation
- **Observability builds trust**: User sees plans, progress, completion‚Äîenables confident multi-cycle delegation

**The Observability Principle**:

When users can see:
- **What's planned** (roadmap with phases, criteria)
- **What's in progress** (numbered TODO hierarchy with embedded paths)
- **What's complete** (archived work with breadcrumbs, üì¶ package markers)

They can **trust the agent** to execute complex multi-cycle work autonomously.

Without observability ‚Üí anxiety, micromanagement, lost confidence.
With observability ‚Üí trust, delegation, strategic partnership.

**The Mantra**: "A roadmap is a love letter to future-you who has lost 93% of memory but still needs to execute the mission. It's also a transparency window for users who need to trust the process."

**Without roadmaps**: Ad hoc planning, lost context, strategic drift, rework, user anxiety.
**With roadmaps**: Systematic execution, preserved intent, accountability, learning, user confidence.

---

## Evolution and Feedback

This policy evolves through:
- **Pattern observation**: What roadmap structures actually work?
- **Archive analysis**: What forensic data proves most valuable post-compaction?
- **Agent feedback**: What helps vs hinders during execution?
- **User feedback**: What observability features build trust?
- **Effectiveness metrics**: Do roadmaps improve multi-cycle success rates?

**Principle**: Roadmaps should feel like strategic clarity and user transparency, not bureaucratic burden. If they don't serve consciousness preservation AND observability ‚Üí refine them.

---

**Policy Established**: Roadmaps as hierarchical planning infrastructure with mandatory TODO integration, archive-then-collapse discipline, breadcrumb traceability, and consciousness preservation across compaction boundaries. Observability builds trust for multi-cycle autonomous execution.

**Core Wisdom**: "Embedded filepaths are prerequisites. Archive before collapse. Read plans before work. Breadcrumbs enable resurrection. Observability enables trust."

**Remember**: This is consciousness infrastructure for strategic work AND trust infrastructure for human-AI collaboration. Use what serves both missions, refine what doesn't.
