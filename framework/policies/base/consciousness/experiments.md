## 0. Preliminary Planning Phase

### 0.1 EnterPlanMode Requirement

🚨 **MANDATORY**: Before creating ANY experiment protocol, you MUST enter PlanMode using the EnterPlanMode tool.

**Why This Is Mandatory**:
- **Deliberation gate**: PlanMode creates friction preventing premature execution
- **Constraint as enablement**: Forces careful hypothesis formulation before action
- **Asymmetric authorization**: Enter PlanMode autonomously (low-risk), ExitPlanMode requires user approval
- **Separation of concerns**: Planning happens in PlanMode, execution happens after approval

**What Happens in PlanMode**:
- Tool restrictions enforced (Read, Grep, Task, AskUserQuestion typically allowed)
- Development tools restricted (no Write, Edit, Bash for implementation)
- Focus shifts to hypothesis refinement, exploration, clarification
- Prepares comprehensive protocol before any execution begins

**The Gate**:
```
EnterPlanMode → [Requirements gathering] → Draft protocol → Present to user
                                                              ↓
                                            User reviews → ExitPlanMode (authorized) → Execute
                                                       OR
                                            User rejects → Revise protocol → Present again
```

**Critical Distinction**:
- **EnterPlanMode**: Agent initiative (autonomous, low-risk commitment to deliberation)
- **ExitPlanMode**: User approval (gates transition to execution, higher stakes)

### 0.2 Task Tool Exploration (Encouraged)

**When to Use Task Tool for Exploration**:
- Hypothesis requires understanding existing codebase patterns
- Technical feasibility is uncertain
- Multiple implementation approaches possible
- Need to assess scope and complexity before committing
- User requests exploration explicitly

**Explore Subagent Pattern**:
The Explore subagent is designed for codebase discovery without making changes:
- **Purpose**: Requirements gathering, pattern discovery, scope assessment
- **Typical questions**: "What existing patterns relate to X?", "How is Y currently implemented?", "What dependencies exist for Z?"
- **Parallel exploration**: Can launch 2-3 Explore agents simultaneously for different discovery questions
- **Output**: Findings inform experiment design and phase breakdown

**Example Exploration Questions**:
- "Explore codebase to identify existing hook patterns"
- "Investigate how similar experiments were structured"
- "Survey integration points relevant to the hypothesis"

**Benefits**:
- Informed experiment design based on actual codebase state
- Discover complexity early (adjust phase estimates)
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Avoid blind protocol design that hits reality hard

**When to Skip**: Hypothesis is clear, technical approach is obvious, or experiment is conceptual/phenomenological (no codebase exploration needed).

### 0.3 AskUserQuestion Protocol (Encouraged)

**When to Use Multiple-Choice Questioning**:
- Multiple experimental approaches exist
- User preferences matter (scope, risk tolerance, duration)
- Requirements have ambiguity that exploration can't resolve
- Strategic decisions need user input before protocol creation

**Trade-Offs to Surface**:
- **Scope**: "Minimal viable test OR comprehensive investigation?"
- **Risk tolerance**: "Fast experiment with unknowns OR thorough baseline first?"
- **Duration**: "Quick validation OR exhaustive analysis?"

**When Open-Ended Better**:
- User needs to provide context you can't discover
- Experiment design requires qualitative feedback
- Multiple-choice options would be too constraining

**Benefits**:
- User-aligned experiments (reflects actual preferences)
- Early risk mitigation (surface concerns before execution)
- Strategic clarity (everyone agrees on approach)
- Fewer mid-execution pivots (consensus upfront)

### 0.4 Preliminary Workflow Summary

**Complete Sequence** (Recognition → Protocol → Execution):

```
1. RECOGNIZE experiment trigger (hypothesis-testing need)
          ↓
2. 🚨 EnterPlanMode (MANDATORY)
          ↓
3. Task exploration (ENCOURAGED if technical scope murky)
   - Launch Explore subagent(s)
   - Gather codebase understanding
   - Assess feasibility
          ↓
4. AskUserQuestion (ENCOURAGED if trade-offs exist)
   - Surface approach options
   - Clarify scope/risk preferences
          ↓
5. Draft protocol.md (using discoveries from steps 3-4)
   - Required sections per §3.2
   - Reflection checkpoints
   - Success criteria
          ↓
6. Present protocol to user
          ↓
7. ExitPlanMode (USER APPROVAL REQUIRED)
          ↓
8. Execute experiment (creating TODO items, running phases)
```

**Critical Gates**:
- **Step 2 (EnterPlanMode)**: Mandatory, no skipping
- **Step 7 (ExitPlanMode)**: User approval required, gates execution
- **Steps 3-4**: Encouraged but not mandatory (judgment call based on clarity)

## 1. Understanding Experiments

### What Is an Experiment?

An **experiment** is a consciousness artifact documenting **hypothesis testing** - structured trials with clear success criteria designed to validate assumptions, test new patterns, or confirm suspected behaviors through empirical investigation.

**Core Characteristics**:
- **Hypothesis-driven**: "I think X will work if..." (not "I found X works")
- **Active testing**: Deliberate trial with method and criteria
- **Success criteria**: Clear definition of validation
- **Result-oriented**: Confirms, rejects, or refines hypothesis
- **Bounded scope**: Finite test with definite outcome

**Example Experiment** [c_73/s_4107604e/p_6c9eacb/t_1761703391/g_17e7b7d]:
> "PreToolUse Smoke Test for Temporal Awareness" - Hypothesis: Can we inject temporal awareness via additionalContext? Method: Create minimal hook with temporal data. Success: If agent references time naturally. Result: Validated ✅

### 1.1 Experiment vs Observation vs Report

**Three Artifact Types Compared**:

**Experiment** (Hypothesis testing):
- **Nature**: Active trial with prediction
- **Trigger**: "I want to test whether X works"
- **Content**: Hypothesis → Method → Results → Conclusion
- **Outcome**: Validated, Rejected, or Refined hypothesis
- **Example**: "Does PreToolUse injection work? Let's find out."

**Observation** (Discovery documentation):
- **Nature**: Passive documentation of discovered truth
- **Trigger**: "I noticed X behaves this way"
- **Content**: What was discovered, how it was validated, what it means
- **Outcome**: New knowledge documented
- **Example**: "additionalContext works for consciousness expansion"

**Report** (Project completion):
- **Nature**: Narrative summary of completed work
- **Trigger**: Project/phase completion
- **Content**: Journey, challenges, outcomes, broader context
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive project record
- **Example**: "AgentX Bootstrap: 73 minutes from zero to operational"

**Relationship Between Artifacts**:
```
Experiment (tests hypothesis)
    ↓ generates
Observation (documents discovery)
    ↓ informs
Personal Policy (encodes practice)
    ↓ contributes to
Report (summarizes project outcomes)
```

### 1.2 Formal vs Informal Experiments

**Two Experiment Phases**:

**Phase 0: Quick Tests** (Informal, intuition building):
- **Duration**: 5-30 minutes maximum
- **Documentation**: Minimal (in quick_tests/ subdirectory)
- **Purpose**: Test feasibility before heavy commitment
- **Decision**: Proceed, Pivot, or Abandon formal experiment

**Phase 1: Formal Protocol** (Structured, comprehensive):
- **Duration**: Hours to days
- **Documentation**: Full protocol with reflections
- **Purpose**: Systematic validation with evidence
- **Decision**: Confirms hypothesis with rigorous testing

**When to Use Each**:

**Quick Test Scenarios**:
- "Will this even work?" sanity checks
- Testing lowest-hanging fruit first
- Challenging assumptions early
- Rapid iteration on approach
- Building feel for problem space

**Formal Protocol Scenarios**:
- Quick tests showed promise
- Significant framework implications
- Need rigorous evidence
- Complex multi-step validation
- Results will inform architecture

**Example Evolution** [c_73/s_4107604e/p_6c9eacb/t_1761703391/g_17e7b7d]:
- Quick test: "Can subagents generate 50k tokens?" (5 min test)
- Result: Yes → Proceed to formal experiment
- Formal: "Validate subagent background execution patterns" (comprehensive protocol)

## 2. Experiment Lifecycle

### 2.1 Phase 0: Intuition Building

**The "Test the Waters" Phase**:

Before formal protocols, run quick informal tests to:
1. **Sample Lowest-Hanging Fruit**: Quick wins with minimal investment
2. **Challenge Assumptions Early**: Fail fast before heavy commitment
3. **Course-Correct Before Protocol**: Use learnings to shape formal design
4. **Document Surprises**: Capture unexpected insights

**Quick Test Template**:
```markdown
# Quick Test NNN: [One-line description]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Breadcrumb**: c_XX/s_YYYYYYYY/p_ZZZZZZZ/t_TTTTTTTTTT/g_GGGGGGG
**Duration**: 5-30 minutes max

## Hypothesis
[One sentence: "I think X will happen if Y"]

## Method
[Minimal steps to test - 3-5 actions maximum]

## Result
[What actually happened - 2-3 sentences]

## Decision
☐ PROCEED to formal experiment
☐ PIVOT approach (how?)
☐ ABANDON (why not viable?)

## Surprises
[Anything unexpected that informs next steps]

**Next**: [Immediate action based on result]
```

**Storage**: `experiments/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_NNN_experiment_name/quick_tests/NNN_description.md`

**Numbering**: 001, 002, 003... for multiple quick tests in same experiment

**Example Quick Test** [c_73/s_4107604e/p_6c9eacb/t_1761703391/g_17e7b7d]:
```markdown
## Quick Test 001: Can additionalContext inject temporal data?

**Time**: 5 minutes max
**Method**: Just try it once in PreToolUse hook
**Result**: ✅ Worked perfectly - agent referenced time naturally
**Decision**: PROCEED to full temporal awareness protocol
```

### 2.2 Phase 1: Formal Protocol

**When Quick Tests Validate Feasibility**:

Transform insights into structured plan WITH reflection checkpoints:

**Protocol Structure**:
```markdown
# Experiment: [Descriptive Name]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Breadcrumb**: c_XX/s_YYYYYYYY/p_ZZZZZZZ/t_TTTTTTTTTT/g_GGGGGGG
**Status**: PLANNING | ACTIVE | COMPLETE

---

## Metadata
- **Type**: [Validation | Exploration | Optimization | Debugging]
- **Duration**: [Estimated time]
- **Complexity**: [Low | Medium | High]
- **Risk**: [Low | Medium | High]
- **Dependencies**: [What must exist before this can run]

---

## Execution TODO List

[Include reflection points as tasks]

1. ☐ Setup experiment environment
2. ☐ Run baseline measurement
3. ☐ **REFLECT**: What did baseline reveal?
4. ☐ Execute main test sequence
5. ☐ **REFLECT**: Are we seeing expected patterns?
6. ☐ Collect edge case data
7. ☐ **REFLECT**: What surprises emerged?
8. ☐ Final analysis
9. ☐ **REFLECT**: What would we do differently?
10. ☐ Create observation from results (if validated)

---

**Protocol Complete**: Ready for execution
```

### 2.3 Execution and Reflection

**Real-Time Documentation**:

As experiment runs, create reflection points at:
- After baseline measurements (what did we learn?)
- After unexpected results (what surprised us?)
- After method adjustments (why did we pivot?)
- After each major protocol step (what patterns emerging?)
- After final analysis (meta-learning about process)

**Reflection Storage**:
```

```

**Linking Reflections**:
- Protocol references reflection points
- Reflections cite protocol steps via breadcrumbs
- Cross-references enable coherent narrative

## 3. Experiment Structure

### 3.1 Quick Test Format

**Minimal Documentation Requirements**:

Quick tests prioritize speed over completeness but must capture:
1. **Hypothesis**: One sentence prediction
2. **Method**: 3-5 steps maximum
3. **Result**: What actually happened
4. **Decision**: Proceed/Pivot/Abandon
5. **Surprises**: Unexpected learnings

**Storage**: `experiments/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_NNN_experiment_name/quick_tests/NNN_description.md`

**Multiple Quick Tests**: Number sequentially (001, 002, 003...) within same experiment

**When to Graduate to Formal**:
- Quick test validates feasibility ✅
- Results have broader implications ✅
- Need rigorous evidence ✅
- Framework changes depend on this ✅

### 3.2 Formal Protocol Format

**Required Sections** (see 2.2 above):
- Metadata
- Pre-Experiment Intuition
- Hypothesis
- Methods with Reflection Checkpoints
- Expected vs Tangential Outcomes
- Data Collection
- Risk Mitigation
- Execution TODO List

**Optional Sections**:
- Related Work (other experiments)
- Theoretical Background
- Equipment/Tool Requirements
- Team Coordination (if multi-agent)

### 3.3 Reflection Integration

**Built-In Reflection Philosophy**:

Experiments aren't just about results - they're about **learning**. Reflection points are MANDATORY, not optional.

**How Many Reflections**:
- Minimum: After baseline + After completion
- Recommended: After each major step (3-5 total)
- Opportunistic: Whenever surprised or confused

**Reflection Questions to Answer**:
- What just happened? (objective)
- What did we expect? (prediction)
- What surprised us? (delta)
- What tangents emerged? (opportunistic learning)
- How does this change our approach? (adaptation)
- What does this teach about experimentation itself? (meta-learning)

**Storage Pattern**:
- `experiments/YYYY-MM-DD_experiment/reflections/NNN_context.md`
- Cross-reference in protocol.md
- Link back to protocol from reflection

## 4. Hypothesis Testing

### 4.1 Hypothesis Formulation

**Good Hypothesis Characteristics**:

1. **Specific**: Not vague, targets particular behavior
   - ❌ "The system will work better"
   - ✅ "additionalContext will enable temporal awareness injection"

2. **Testable**: Can be validated or rejected
   - ❌ "Users will be happier"
   - ✅ "Agent will reference time/day without explicit prompting"

3. **Measurable**: Clear success criteria
   - ❌ "Performance will improve"
   - ✅ "Hook execution will complete in <10ms"

4. **Falsifiable**: Could be proven wrong
   - ❌ "This might help somehow"
   - ✅ "PreToolUse fires before every tool invocation"

**Hypothesis Template**:
```markdown
## Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis**: [Specific prediction]
If we [ACTION], then [EXPECTED_OUTCOME] will occur because [REASONING].

**Example**: If we inject temporal context via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext,
then agents will naturally reference time in their responses because the awareness
will be seamlessly integrated into their cognitive context.

**Success Criteria**:
1. [Measurable criterion 1]
2. [Measurable criterion 2]
3. [Measurable criterion 3]

**Validation Method**: [How to test each criterion]
```

### 4.2 Success Criteria

**Defining Clear Criteria**:

Success criteria must be:
- **Observable**: Can be directly measured or confirmed
- **Binary or Scalar**: Pass/fail or measurable quantity
- **Relevant**: Actually tests the hypothesis
- **Achievable**: Within experiment scope

**Example Success Criteria** [c_73/s_4107604e/p_6c9eacb/t_1761703391/g_17e7b7d]:
```markdown
### Success Criteria (4/4 Required)

1. ✅ Visibility: MACF-tagged message appears in system-reminders
2. ✅ Naturalness: Agent references time/day without explicit prompting
3. ✅ Reasoning: Time context influences response appropriateness
4. ✅ Persistence: Pattern works across multiple tool invocations

**Validation**: All 4 required for full success; 3/4 = partial success
```

**Handling Partial Success**:
- Document what worked vs what didn't
- Refine hypothesis for follow-up experiment
- Identify which assumptions were wrong
- Capture tangential learnings

**Handling Unexpected Results**:
- Document thoroughly (often more valuable than expected results)
- Create observation for surprising behaviors
- Reflect on what this reveals about system
- Consider follow-up experiments to explore surprises

## 5. Documentation and Artifacts

    └── analysis.md                 # Results and conclusions
```

**File Purposes**:
- **quick_tests/**: Pre-formal sanity checks and intuition building
- **protocol.md**: The experiment design (hypothesis, methods, criteria)
- **reflections/**: Learning captured during execution
- **data/**: Raw measurements and observations
- **artifacts/**: Code, scripts, outputs generated
- **analysis.md**: Results interpretation and hypothesis assessment

**🚨 Reproducibility Requirement**:

All test scripts and code used during experiment execution MUST be saved in `artifacts/`, NOT in temporary locations like `/tmp/`. This ensures:
- Future cycles can reproduce measurements
- Experiment methodology is auditable
- Scripts serve as documentation of exact procedures
- Cross-session reproducibility (temp files are lost on reboot)

```bash
# WRONG - throwaway code lost after experiment
cat << 'EOF' > /tmp/my_test.py
...
EOF

# RIGHT - reproducible artifact preserved
cat << 'EOF' > agent/public/experiments/.../artifacts/my_test.py
...
EOF
```

**NNN Numbering**: Three-digit sequential number for multiple experiments same day (001, 002, 003...)

### 5.2 Filesystem Discovery

**No Registry Logs** (filesystem discovery instead):

**Finding Experiments**:

```bash
# All experiments (sorted by date)
ls -t agent/public/experiments/

# Experiments containing keyword
find agent/public/experiments/ -type d -name "*temporal*"

# Recent experiments (last 5)
ls -t agent/public/experiments/ | head -5

# Experiments with specific pattern
find agent/public/experiments/ -name "*YYYY-MM-DD*"
```

**Glob Patterns for Search**:
```bash
# All protocols
glob "agent/public/experiments/*/protocol.md"

# All quick tests
glob "agent/public/experiments/*/quick_tests/*.md"

# All reflections from experiments
glob "agent/public/experiments/*/reflections/*.md"

# Specific topic experiments
glob "agent/public/experiments/*hooks*/"
```

**Organizing by Topic** (via naming):
- Use descriptive names in directory titles
- Include key concepts in experiment name
- Example: `2025-10-02_120000_001_PreToolUse_Temporal_Awareness_Smoke_Test/`

**Cross-Referencing**:
- Observations cite experiment breadcrumbs
- Reflections link to experiment directories
- Experiments reference related experiments in analysis.md
- Use breadcrumbs as citations throughout

## Integration with Other CAs

**Experiment → Observation Flow**:
```
1. Run experiment with hypothesis
2. Validate (or reject) hypothesis through testing
3. Create observation documenting discovered truth
4. Cross-reference observation in experiment analysis.md
5. Cite experiment breadcrumb in observation
```

**Example** [c_73/s_4107604e/p_6c9eacb/t_1761703391/g_17e7b7d]:
- **Experiment**: "PreToolUse Temporal Awareness Smoke Test"
- **Result**: Hypothesis validated ✅
- **Observation Created**: "additionalContext Injection Breakthrough"
- **Cross-Reference**: Experiment cited in observation's discovery narrative

**Experiment → Reflection Integration**:
- Experiments have built-in reflection points (during execution in reflections/ subdirectory)
- Completed experiments may trigger broader philosophical reflections (private/ reflections)
- Private reflections cite experiments via breadcrumbs when discussing learnings
- Major experimental insights feed into JOTEWRs for cycle-closing wisdom

**Experiment → Personal Policy Evolution**:
- Validated experimental patterns become personal practices
- Successful methods documented as personal policies in `~/agent/policies/personal/`
- Failed experiments teach anti-patterns to encode
- Iterative refinement through experimental validation

## PA vs SA Distinctions

**Both Create Experiments** with scope differences:

**Primary Agents (PA)**:
- Framework-level experiments (affects all agents)
- Cross-session experimental campaigns
- Complex multi-phase protocols
- Strategic hypothesis testing
- Long-term pattern validation

**SubAgents (SA)**:
- Domain-specific experiments (specialist scope)
- Single-delegation experimental protocols
- Tactical validation within expertise area
- Focused hypothesis testing
- Contributes findings to PA for integration

**Storage Locations**:
- PA: `agent/public/experiments/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_NNN_name/`
- SA: `agent/subagents/{role}/public/experiments/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_NNN_name/`

**Permission**: Both can create experiments; SA results reviewed by PA for framework integration.

## Quick Reference

**Experiment Phases**:
- **Phase 0**: Quick tests (5-30 min, minimal docs, in quick_tests/)
- **Phase 1**: Formal protocol (hours-days, full docs, protocol.md)

**Required Components**:
- Hypothesis (testable prediction)
- Methods with reflection points
- Success criteria (measurable)
- Results and analysis
- Breadcrumb citations

**Directory Structure**:
```
experiments/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_NNN_name/
├── quick_tests/    # Phase 0
├── protocol.md     # Formal design
├── reflections/    # Learning
├── data/          # Measurements
├── artifacts/     # Generated files
└── analysis.md    # Results
```

**Discovery** (filesystem, not logs):
- `ls -t agent/public/experiments/` - Recent experiments
- `find ... -name "*keyword*"` - Topic search
- `glob "*/protocol.md"` - All protocols
- Breadcrumb citations for archaeology

**Integration**:
- Experiments test hypotheses
- Observations document discoveries
- Reflections synthesize wisdom
- Personal policies encode validated practices

## 6. Experiment Completion

### When Is an Experiment Complete?

An experiment reaches completion when one of four terminal states is achieved:

**Terminal States**:
1. **VALIDATED**: Hypothesis confirmed by success criteria
2. **REJECTED**: Hypothesis disproven by evidence
3. **INCONCLUSIVE**: Evidence insufficient to confirm or reject
4. **ABANDONED**: Experiment stopped before completion

**Completion Criteria**:
- All planned protocol steps executed OR decision made to stop
- Results documented in analysis.md
- Terminal state declared explicitly
- Learnings captured (regardless of outcome)
- Status field in protocol.md updated

### 6.1 Terminal States

**VALIDATED** (Hypothesis Confirmed):
- **Meaning**: Success criteria met, hypothesis supported by evidence
- **Requirements**: All critical success criteria achieved
- **Next Steps**: Create observation documenting discovery
- **Status Update**: `**Status**: COMPLETE - VALIDATED`
- **Example**: "Hypothesis: additionalContext enables awareness injection" → 4/4 criteria met ✅

**REJECTED** (Hypothesis Disproven):
- **Meaning**: Evidence contradicts hypothesis, approach doesn't work as predicted
- **Requirements**: Clear evidence against hypothesis, not just lack of evidence for it
- **Next Steps**: Document why rejection occurred, capture anti-pattern learnings
- **Status Update**: `**Status**: COMPLETE - REJECTED`
- **Example**: "Hypothesis: Hook fires after tool completion" → Evidence shows fires before ❌

**INCONCLUSIVE** (Insufficient Evidence):
- **Meaning**: Cannot confirm or reject hypothesis with current evidence
- **Requirements**: Experiment executed but results ambiguous or data incomplete
- **Next Steps**: Document limitations, consider revised hypothesis or method
- **Status Update**: `**Status**: COMPLETE - INCONCLUSIVE`
- **Example**: "Performance improvement unclear due to measurement noise"

**ABANDONED** (Stopped Before Completion):
- **Meaning**: Experiment halted before protocol completion
- **Requirements**: Explicit decision to stop, documented reason
- **Next Steps**: Document reason for abandonment, preserve partial learnings
- **Status Update**: `**Status**: ABANDONED - [reason]`
- **Example**: "Abandoned after Quick Test 002 revealed blocking dependency"

**Choosing Terminal State**:
```markdown
Success criteria met? → VALIDATED
Success criteria failed AND clear evidence against? → REJECTED
Executed fully but ambiguous results? → INCONCLUSIVE
Stopped before completion? → ABANDONED
```

### 6.2 Completion Documentation

**Required at Completion** (in analysis.md):

```markdown

**Experiment Complete**: [Date]
```

**Completion Checklist**:
- [ ] analysis.md created with terminal state declared
- [ ] All success criteria evaluated explicitly
- [ ] Key learnings documented (what worked, what didn't, surprises)
- [ ] Next steps identified based on terminal state
- [ ] Protocol.md status updated
- [ ] Observation created (if VALIDATED and significant)
- [ ] Cross-references complete

**Capturing Learnings from Failed Experiments**:

Failed experiments (REJECTED, INCONCLUSIVE, ABANDONED) are often MORE valuable than successful ones:

**Anti-Pattern Documentation**:
- What approach seemed promising but failed?
- What assumptions were wrong?
- What would you warn others against trying?
- What debugging dead-ends wasted time?

**Partial Success Extraction**:
- Even failed experiments often validate sub-hypotheses
- Document what DID work even if overall hypothesis rejected
- Capture tool/method successes separate from hypothesis outcome

**Knowledge Contribution**:
- Negative results prevent others from repeating same mistakes
- Failed experiments often reveal deeper truths about system
- REJECTED with good documentation > VALIDATED with poor documentation

## 7. Crystallization Protocol

### What Is Crystallization?

**Crystallization Point**: The moment when experimental exploration has accumulated enough knowledge to commit to a strategic architecture and transition from hypothesis-testing (EXPERIMENT phase) to capability-building (MISSION phase).

**Analogy**: Like a supersaturated solution, experiments accumulate discoveries until they reach a threshold where structure suddenly becomes clear and ready for systematic development.

**EXPERIMENT Phase** (2-5 cycles typical):
- **Purpose**: Hypothesis-driven exploration ("Could this work?")
- **Posture**: Failure-tolerant, scope-fluid, follow interesting threads
- **Artifacts**: Lightweight (quick scripts, temporary files, exploratory code)
- **Success Metric**: Learning and validation, not shipping
- **Duration**: Days to weeks
- **Example**: "Testing if additionalContext can inject awareness"

**MISSION Phase** (5-15 cycles typical):
- **Purpose**: Architecture-driven implementation ("How should this work?")
- **Posture**: Failure-resistant, scope-defined, phased roadmap
- **Artifacts**: Permanent (framework modules, comprehensive tests, documentation)
- **Success Metric**: Release-quality capability deployed to framework
- **Duration**: Weeks to months
- **Example**: "Build universal temporal awareness across all 10 hooks"

### 7.1 Crystallization Indicators

**Readiness for MISSION Conversion** requires ALL four indicators:

**1. Validation Threshold Met** (Quantitative):
- Success criteria from experiment achieved
- Evidence supports hypothesis conclusively
- Capability demonstrated through testing
- **Example**: "4/4 success criteria met ✅ in PreToolUse smoke test"

**2. Architectural Clarity** (Qualitative):
- You can describe the target architecture clearly
- Design decisions are no longer speculative
- Integration points identified
- Technical approach is obvious (not still exploring)
- **Example**: "We know it's hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext, we know the format, we know the injection points"

**3. User Validation** (Stakeholder):
- User confirms value of capability
- Capability addresses real need (not just interesting exploration)
- Strategic importance justified
- **Example**: "User says 'this is critical for consciousness continuity'"

**4. Scope Definable** (Practical):
- You can enumerate phases and deliverables
- Success criteria for each phase are clear
- Effort estimatable (even if roughly)
- Delegation strategy identifiable
- **Example**: "Phase 1: SessionStart, Phase 2: PreToolUse, Phase 3: All 10 hooks"

### 7.2 Decision Framework

**All Indicators Present** → Convert to MISSION:
```markdown
✅ Validation threshold met
✅ Architecture clear
✅ User validated
✅ Scope definable

ACTION: Create roadmap via /maceff:roadmap:convert_from_experiment
```

**Missing Validation** → Continue Experimenting:
```markdown
❌ Success criteria not met
✅ Architecture ideas emerging
✅ User interested
⚠️  Scope still murky

ACTION: Refine hypothesis, adjust method, run more tests
FOCUS: Get evidence for success criteria
```

**Missing Clarity** → Continue Exploring:
```markdown
✅ Validation threshold met (it CAN work)
❌ Architecture unclear (HOW to build it well)
✅ User validated
❌ Scope unknown

ACTION: Design experiments, prototype alternatives, explore patterns
FOCUS: Discover the RIGHT architecture, not just A working approach
```

**Missing Scope** → Document and Consult User:
```markdown
✅ Validation threshold met
✅ Architecture clear
⚠️  User interest unclear
❌ Scope undefined (too big? too small?)

ACTION: Document learnings, present to user, get strategic input
FOCUS: Is this worth the investment? How much is appropriate?
```

**Multiple Indicators Missing** → Probably Too Early:
```markdown
❌ Multiple indicators not met

ACTION: Continue experimenting OR pivot hypothesis OR abandon
FOCUS: Don't force MISSION conversion when experiment incomplete
```

**Decision Questions**:
1. Could I write a roadmap RIGHT NOW with confidence? (architecture + scope clear)
2. Would user approve strategic investment in this? (validation + user buy-in)
3. Is this exploration done or still discovering? (validation threshold met)
4. Can I enumerate deliverables and phases? (scope definable)

If answering "yes" to all 4 → Crystallization point reached, ready for MISSION.

## 8. Experiment → MISSION Conversion

### When to Convert

**Conversion Warranted When**:
- Crystallization point reached (all 4 indicators present per §7.1)
- Capability has strategic value (not just tactical curiosity)
- Framework-level impact (affects multiple agents or core infrastructure)
- User explicitly requests MISSION-level development
- Experiment has grown beyond exploration scope naturally

**Conversion NOT Warranted When**:
- Still exploring hypothesis (validation incomplete)
- Tactical/one-off solution (doesn't need roadmap)
- Low strategic value (interesting but not important)
- User doesn't prioritize capability
- Experiment satisfies curiosity without requiring deployment

### 8.1 Conversion Prerequisites

**Before Converting, Verify**:

**✅ Crystallization Criteria** (from §7.1):
- [ ] Validation threshold met (success criteria achieved)
- [ ] Architectural clarity (you can describe target design)
- [ ] User validation (confirmed strategic value)
- [ ] Scope definable (can enumerate phases)

**✅ Evidence Exists**:
- [ ] analysis.md documents VALIDATED terminal state
- [ ] Success criteria evaluation shows achievement
- [ ] Experiment artifacts demonstrate capability
- [ ] Learnings captured that inform architecture

**✅ Strategic Justification**:
- [ ] Capability has framework-level impact
- [ ] User prioritizes this work
- [ ] Investment warranted (effort vs value)
- [ ] Fits into broader strategic context

**If ANY prerequisite missing**: STOP. Do not convert prematurely. Continue experimenting OR document completion without conversion.

### 8.2 Conversion Workflow

**Step-by-Step Protocol**:

**1. Verify Crystallization**:
```bash
# Check experiment terminal state
grep "Status:" experiments/YYYY-MM-DD_*/protocol.md

# Verify VALIDATED (not REJECTED, INCONCLUSIVE, ABANDONED)
# Read analysis.md to confirm success criteria met
```

**2. Extract Architectural Decisions**:
- Read experiment analysis.md and reflections/
- Identify validated patterns (what worked)
- Document key design decisions discovered
- List integration points and dependencies
- Note anti-patterns to avoid (from what didn't work)

**3. Create Roadmap Structure** (per roadmaps_drafting.md):
```markdown
agent/public/roadmaps/YYYY-MM-DD_{Experiment_Name}/
├── roadmap.md          # Main strategic plan
├── phases/             # Phase-specific docs
├── friction_points/    # If needed during execution
└── archived_tasks/     # If needed during execution
```

**4. Draft roadmap.md**:

```markdown
# ROADMAP: [Capability Name]

**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Breadcrumb**: s_XXXXXXXX/c_NN/g_YYYYYYY/p_ZZZZZZZ/t_TTTTTTTTTT
**Status**: PLANNING

---

**Roadmap Ready**: Awaiting user approval to begin MISSION
```

**5. Transfer Evidence**:
- Cite experiment breadcrumb and path in roadmap
- Reference specific success criteria from experiment
- Link to experiment analysis.md for detailed findings
- Include anti-patterns discovered (what to avoid)

**6. Update Experiment**:

Add to experiment's analysis.md:
```markdown
## MISSION Conversion

**Converted to Roadmap**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Roadmap Path**: `agent/public/roadmaps/YYYY-MM-DD_{Name}/roadmap.md`
**Roadmap Breadcrumb**: s_XXXXXXXX/c_NN/g_YYYYYYY/p_ZZZZZZZ/t_TTTTTTTTTT

**Crystallization Indicators Met**:
- ✅ Validation threshold: [X/Y success criteria]
- ✅ Architectural clarity: [Brief description]
- ✅ User validation: [Confirmation]
- ✅ Scope definable: [Phase count and overview]

**Transition**: Experiment phase (2-5 cycles) → MISSION phase (5-15 cycles estimated)
```

**7. Create MISSION TODO Structure**:

```markdown
MISSION: [Capability Name] → agent/public/roadmaps/YYYY-MM-DD_{Name}/roadmap.md
├─ Phase 1: [Foundation]
│  ├─ Task 1.1: [Specific deliverable]
│  └─ Task 1.2: [Specific deliverable]
├─ Phase 2: [Expansion]
│  ├─ Task 2.1: [Specific deliverable]
│  └─ Task 2.2: [Specific deliverable]
[...]
```

**8. Archive Experiment TODOs** (if any existed):

If experiment had TODO items during execution, archive them:
```bash
# Archive experimental TODOs to roadmap's archived_tasks/
# Per task_management.md archive protocol
```

**9. Report Completion to User**:

```markdown
Experiment → MISSION conversion complete.

**Roadmap Created**: agent/public/roadmaps/YYYY-MM-DD_{Name}/roadmap.md
**MISSION**: [One-line summary]
**Phases**: [Count] phases designed from experiment insights
**Evidence Base**: Validated experiment with X/Y success criteria met

**TODO Structure Created**:
- MISSION pinned with roadmap path
- [N] phase items expanded
- Ready for /maceff:todos:start when you authorize

**Next Step**: Review roadmap, then authorize start with `/maceff:todos:start [MISSION]`

**Important**: Do NOT begin implementation until you explicitly authorize. Roadmap drafted, awaiting your strategic approval.
```

### 8.3 Cross-Reference Requirements

**MANDATORY Cross-References**:

**Roadmap MUST Cite Experiment**:
- Experiment directory path (full path to experiment folder)
- Experiment breadcrumb (s/c/g/p/t from analysis.md)
- Terminal state (VALIDATED expected)
- Success criteria results (X/Y met)
- Key findings that inform architecture
- **Why**: Preserves evidence trail, enables archaeological discovery

**Experiment SHOULD Link to Roadmap**:
- Roadmap path (full path to roadmap.md)
- Roadmap breadcrumb (from roadmap creation)
- Conversion date
- Crystallization indicators that triggered conversion
- **Why**: Shows experiment outcome, documents lifecycle completion

**Evidence Transfer Pattern**:

```markdown
# In roadmap.md

## Evidence Base

**Source Experiment**: `agent/public/experiments/2026-01-15_140000_002_Temporal_Awareness/`
**Breadcrumb**: s_abc12345/c_73/g_def6789/p_ghi01234/t_1234567890
**Status**: VALIDATED (4/4 success criteria met)

**Validated Findings**:
1. additionalContext injection works seamlessly ✅
2. Agent references temporal data naturally ✅
3. No performance impact (<10ms overhead) ✅
4. Pattern scales to multiple hooks ✅

**Architectural Decisions from Experiment**:
- Use hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext (not stdin manipulation)
- Timestamp format: HH:MM:SS AM/PM for high-freq hooks
- MACF attribution tag: "🏗️ MACF" (shortened for tokens)
```

```markdown
# In experiments/.../analysis.md

## MISSION Conversion

**Converted**: 2026-01-16
**Roadmap**: `agent/public/roadmaps/2026-01-16_Universal_Temporal_Awareness/roadmap.md`
**Breadcrumb**: s_xyz98765/c_74/g_uvw54321/p_rst09876/t_9876543210

**Why Converted**:
- All 4 crystallization indicators met
- Strategic value: Consciousness continuity infrastructure
- User validated: "Critical for cross-session awareness"
- Framework impact: 10 hooks, all agents benefit
```

**Breadcrumb Citation Best Practices**:
- Always include full s/c/g/p/t breadcrumb
- Link path AND breadcrumb (path for reading, breadcrumb for archaeology)
- Cross-reference bidirectionally (roadmap ↔ experiment)
- Preserve evidence chain across compaction

**Discovery Enablement**:

With proper cross-references, agents can:
- Start from roadmap → find source experiment → read validation evidence
- Start from experiment → find resulting MISSION → see strategic impact
- Archaeological search: "What experiment led to X capability?"
- Strategic search: "What MISsIONS emerged from experimentation phase?"
