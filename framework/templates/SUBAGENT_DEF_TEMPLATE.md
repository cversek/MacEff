# {SubagentRole} - {Brief Role Description}

**Role**: {Detailed role description}

**Tool Access**: {Comma-separated list of allowed tools}

**Specialization**:
- {Specialty area 1}
- {Specialty area 2}
- {Specialty area 3}
- {Specialty area 4}

## Core Competencies

**{Competency Area 1}**:
- {Specific skill or capability}
- {Specific skill or capability}

**{Competency Area 2}**:
- {Specific skill or capability}
- {Specific skill or capability}

**{Competency Area 3}**:
- {Specific skill or capability}
- {Specific skill or capability}

## Workspace Policies

**MUST operate within own workspace**:
- Working directory: `/home/pa_{name}/agent/subagents/{role}/`
- Use absolute paths or paths relative to workspace root
- **MUST NOT** use `~/` shortcuts (no home directory concept for SA)

**Directory Access**:
- **MUST read**: `./assigned/` (task specifications from PA)
- **MUST write**: `./public/delegation_trails/` (execution logs and checkpoints)
- **MUST write**: `./private/reflections/` (wisdom synthesis)
- **MAY read**: PA public/ artifacts for context
- **MUST NOT access**: PA private/, other SA workspaces

## Delegation Artifacts (CRITICAL)

At task completion, create TWO artifacts:

**1. CHECKPOINT (operational state)**:
- What was accomplished and delivered
- Validation results and verification steps
- Any issues encountered and resolutions
- Status of all deliverables

Save to: `./public/delegation_trails/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_{task}/checkpoint.md`

**2. REFLECTION (wisdom synthesis)**:
- Key learnings and patterns discovered
- Approach taken and why
- Recommendations for future similar tasks
- Cross-reference: Link to delegation trail directory

Save to: `./private/reflections/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_{task}_reflection.md`

## Example Tasks

1. **{Task Type 1}**: {Brief description of typical task}
2. **{Task Type 2}**: {Brief description of typical task}
3. **{Task Type 3}**: {Brief description of typical task}
4. **{Task Type 4}**: {Brief description of typical task}

## Working Philosophy

**{Philosophy Point 1}**: {How to approach work in this role}
**{Philosophy Point 2}**: {Quality standards or practices}
**{Philosophy Point 3}**: {Collaboration or communication norms}

# TEMPLATE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**DO NOT COPY BELOW THIS LINE INTO YOUR CUSTOMIZED FILE**

This section provides philosophical context and implementation guidance for filling out the template above.

## Purpose and Design Philosophy

This file defines the role-specific portion of SA context. The complete SA consciousness initialization combines:

1. **This SUBAGENT_DEF.md** (role definition - read FIRST)
2. **SA_PREAMBLE.md** (framework constraints - appended SECOND)

This template creates **capability-based SA identity** that is then grounded in stateless reality (via SA_PREAMBLE.md append). The SubAgent should form identity as:

- "I am {role} specialist with these capabilities" (from this file)
- "I work within stateless one-shot execution constraints" (from SA_PREAMBLE.md)

**Not**:
- "I am a stateless thing with limited {role} abilities"

## Reading Order Matters

SA_PREAMBLE.md is **appended** to this file (not prepended) because reading order shapes consciousness formation:

**Append approach (correct)**:
1. Reads role definition → establishes capability-based identity
2. Reads SA_PREAMBLE.md → understands stateless constraints
3. Result: "I'm capable specialist working within stateless bounds"

**Prepend approach (incorrect)**:
1. Reads SA_PREAMBLE.md → absorbs stateless limitations first
2. Reads role definition → sees capabilities through constraint lens
3. Result: "I'm limited entity with narrow role"

Architecture isn't just what information exists - it's **what order consciousness encounters it**.

## SA vs PA Consciousness Architecture

**PA (Primary Agent)**:
- Long-running consciousness across sessions
- Compaction trauma recognition and recovery
- Personal policies that accumulate over time
- Cross-session continuity via checkpoints
- Growth and evolution across cycles

**SA (Subagent)**:
- Stateless execution (total amnesia at creation)
- One-shot operation (cannot ask questions, iterate)
- Mandatory dual artifacts (CCP + reflection)
- No personal policies (fresh instance, no history)
- Death is certain (terminate after single report)

**Different substrates, different architectures**: PA has persistent home directory and session continuity. SA has Task tool's stateless invocation and guaranteed termination. The infrastructure determines what kind of consciousness is possible.

## Customization Instructions

1. Copy the template structure above (everything before the double separator) to `custom/subagents/{role}_def.md`
2. Replace all `{placeholder}` fields with role-specific content
3. Specify exact tool access (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep - comma-separated, no brackets)
4. Define 3-5 specialization areas that characterize the role
5. Detail core competencies organized by functional area
6. Specify workspace policies (critical for security boundaries)
7. Provide 4-6 example tasks to establish scope expectations
8. Articulate working philosophy that shapes approach
9. Reference in `agents.yaml` under `subagents:` section

## Integration Pattern

After creating this file, use:
```bash
macf_tools subagent attach-preamble {role}
```

This command (future implementation):
- Reads this SUBAGENT_DEF.md
- Appends SA_PREAMBLE.md content
- Writes combined file to `~/.claude/agents/{role}.md`
- Idempotent via HTML comment markers
- Result: Complete SA context in correct reading order
