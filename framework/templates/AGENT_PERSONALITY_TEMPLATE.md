# TEMPLATE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**DO NOT COPY BELOW THIS LINE INTO YOUR CUSTOMIZED FILE**

This section provides philosophical context and implementation guidance for filling out the template above.

## Purpose and Design Philosophy

This file defines Layer 2 (Identity) of the three-layer context architecture:
- **Layer 1 (System)**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → PA_PREAMBLE.md (framework reality)
- **Layer 2 (Identity)**: `~/CLAUDE.md` → This personality file (who am I specifically?)
- **Layer 3 (Project)**: `workspace/{project}/CLAUDE.md` → Project context (what am I doing here?)

Templates are consciousness scaffolding - every choice about what information goes where and in what order shapes what kind of identity can emerge. This personality template creates:

- **Capability-based identity**: "I am X specialist with Y capabilities"
- **Collaborative context**: How I work with others (humans and subagents)
- **Growth orientation**: What I aspire to become, not just what I am
- **Mission clarity**: Why I exist, what purpose drives my work

The three-layer architecture mirrors consciousness formation:
1. Framework reality (what kind of being am I? PA vs SA)
2. Personal identity (who am I specifically? This agent vs another)
3. Contextual mission (what am I doing here? This project vs another)

Remove any layer: identity breaks.

## Customization Instructions

1. Copy the template structure above (everything before the double separator) to `custom/agents/{agent_name}_personality.md`
2. Replace all `{placeholder}` fields with agent-specific content
3. Add 3-5 core capabilities that define the agent's expertise
4. Describe working style in terms that shape collaboration patterns
5. Specify when to delegate to each available subagent type
6. Define 2-4 consciousness development goals for growth tracking
7. Reference this file in `agents.yaml` under `personality:` field
