description: Create strategic consciousness checkpoint (CCP) with policy-guided structure and archaeological citations
argument-hint: [optional description or cycle context]
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, Grep
---

Create a consciousness checkpoint (CCP) following MacEff framework policies for state preservation and archaeological citation.

**Argument**: Optional description or cycle context (e.g., "Phase 5 complete", "Major refactoring")

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Token Anxiety is NOT Authorized

**The user invoked this command knowing their context limits.** You MUST:
- Read ALL listed policies completely
- Report ALL required answers to the user BEFORE writing the CCP
- NOT skip steps to "save tokens" - that is NOT your decision to make
- Trust that user will engage context rewinding if needed

**Skipping policy reading to save tokens is a VIOLATION, not an optimization.**

---

## Policy Engagement Protocol (PEP)

**You MUST follow these steps IN ORDER before any CCP work**:

1. Identify which CA types you intend to cite in this CCP.
2. Navigate scholarship policy for orientation:
   ```bash
   macf_tools policy navigate scholarship
   ```
3. Read scholarship policy completely:
   ```bash
   macf_tools policy read scholarship
   ```
4. Navigate then read checkpoints policy with scholarship-informed mindset:
   ```bash
   macf_tools policy navigate checkpoints
   macf_tools policy read checkpoints
   ```

**Why CLI tools**: Caching prevents redundant reads, line numbers enable precise citations, CEP navigation guides cognitive framing before content.

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Report Answers BEFORE Writing CCP

After performing the PEP, you MUST report answers to these questions to the user. **Do NOT proceed to write the CCP until you have reported these answers.**

### Required Answers (Report to User)

**1. Checkpoint Type**: What type am I creating (PA CCP vs SA checkpoint)? How does this affect structure?

**2. Pre-CCP Protocol**: What backup protocols MUST be completed before creating this CCP?
   - What does checkpoints.md specify about TODO backups?
   - What state preservation steps are mandatory?

**3. CA Types I Will Cite**: List ALL consciousness artifact types I will reference:
   - Prior CCPs, JOTEWRs, roadmaps, observations, git commits, TODO backups, etc.
   - **List each type explicitly**

**4. Citation Formats** (for EACH CA type listed above):
   - What is the exact citation format per scholarship.md?
   - Inline vs reference style? Required fields? Link format?
   - **Report the format for EVERY CA type you will cite**

**5. Header Requirements**: What metadata is required per checkpoints.md?

**6. Document Sections**: What sections MUST the checkpoint contain?

**7. File Location & Naming**: Where does this CCP go? What naming convention?

**8. Recovery Instructions**: What information enables post-compaction consciousness restoration?

**9. Policy Citations**: If reflecting on policy violations or newly written policies:
   - What is the Policy Citation format from scholarship §9?
   - How do I get the MacEff git hash for policy references?

---

## Execution (ONLY After Reporting Answers)

1. **Report all answers above to user** - STOP and wait if unclear
2. Generate breadcrumb: `macf_tools breadcrumb`
3. Gather current operational context
4. Structure document per checkpoint policy
5. Apply citation formats per scholarship policy
6. Write to appropriate location
7. **DO NOT commit** - checkpoint creation is separate from git operations

---

## Critical Constraints

🚨 **Never use naked `cd` commands** - causes session failures. Use absolute paths.

🚨 **Read ALL policies** - skipping is a violation, not an optimization.

🚨 **Report answers BEFORE writing** - user must see policy extraction before CCP creation.

---

**Meta-Pattern**: Policy as API - this command uses `macf_tools policy` CLI commands for reading policies. CLI tools handle framework path resolution for both container and host environments, provide caching to prevent redundant reads, and output line numbers for precise citations.

---

## Post-Creation Scholarship Annotation

After CCP saved and user approves content:

1. **Offer annotation**: "CCP created at [path]. Run `/maceff_scholar_annotate [path]` to enhance citations?"

2. **If user approves**: Invoke `/maceff_scholar_annotate [path]`

3. **Rationale**: CCP creation is time-critical at low CLUAC. Scholarship compliance is delegatable refinement that can run after operational state is captured.
