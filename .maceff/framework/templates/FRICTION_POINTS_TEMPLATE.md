## How to Cite Friction Points

**Full Roadmap Citation**:
```
[Roadmap YYYY-MM-DD "Roadmap Title": s_XXXXXXXX/c_NN/g_YYYYYYY/p_ZZZZZZZ/t_TTTTTTTTTT](../roadmap.md)
```

**Individual FP Citation Format**:
```
[Roadmap YYYY-MM-DD "Roadmap Title" FP#{N} "FP Brief Title": s_XXXXXXXX/c_NN/g_YYYYYYY/p_ZZZZZZZ/t_TTTTTTTTTT](./friction_points.md#fpN-anchor)
```

**Example** (update with actual values when creating friction_points.md):
```
[Roadmap 2025-11-11 "Docker DETOUR" FP#1 "Override Discovery": s_abc12345/c_42/g_def6789/p_ghi01234/t_1234567890](./friction_points.md#fp1-docker-composeoverrideyml-working-directory-dependency)
```

**Usage**: Copy this format when citing friction points from checkpoints, reflections, or other roadmaps. See scholarship.md policy for complete enhanced citation guidelines.
