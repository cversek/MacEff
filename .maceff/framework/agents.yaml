# MannyMacEff v0.3.0 Named Agents Configuration
#
# REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION: MacEff v0.3.0 Named Agents Architecture
# See framework/README.md for comprehensive architecture documentation
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# - Three-Layer CLAUDE.md: System (PA_PREAMBLE) + Identity (personality) + Project (context)
# - Framework Overlay: Parent framework/ → maceff-init → .maceff/framework/
# - Consciousness Artifacts: Private (checkpoints, reflections) + Public (roadmaps, reports)
# - Subagent Delegation: Task tool invocation with workspace boundaries
#
# CROSS-REFERENCES:
# - Architecture: framework/README.md
# - MacEff Docs: MacEff/docs/arch_v0.3_named_agents/01_overview.md
# - Implementation: MacEff/docs/arch_v0.3_named_agents/05_implementation_guide.md

# ============================================================================
# PRIMARY AGENTS (PAs)
# ============================================================================
# Interactive agents with SSH access, consciousness artifacts, project assignments

agents:
  manny:
    # System username (creates /home/pa_manny/)
    username: pa_manny

    # Identity layer (Layer 2 CLAUDE.md)
    # Copied to ~/CLAUDE.md during agent creation
    # Path relative to .maceff/framework/ root (after maceff-init copy)
    personality: agents/manny_personality.md

    # Delegatable subagents (Task tool)
    subagents: [devops_eng, test_eng, data_scientist]

    # Project assignments (Layer 3 CLAUDE.md)
    # Creates workspace symlinks: ~/workspace/NeuroVEP -> /shared_workspace/NeuroVEP
    assigned_projects: [NeuroVEP]

    # Consciousness artifact directories (optional)
    # See framework/README.md for CA types and locations
    consciousness_artifacts:
      private: [checkpoints, reflections, learnings]
      public: [roadmaps, reports, observations, experiments]

    # Hook integration (requires macf in base conda env)
    # Provides: compaction detection, temporal awareness, DEV_DRV/DELEG_DRV tracking
    hooks:
      enabled: [session_start, user_prompt_submit, pre_tool_use, post_tool_use, stop, subagent_stop]

# ============================================================================
# SUBAGENTS (SAs)
# ============================================================================
# Delegation-only agents (nologin shell, Task tool invocation)
# Definitions get SA_PREAMBLE appended via: macf_tools subagent init {role}
# See Friction Point #4: Command not yet implemented

  data_scientist:
    role: Data analysis and visualization specialist
    shell: /usr/sbin/nologin
    tool_access: Read, Bash, Glob, Grep  # Read-only for safety
    consciousness_artifacts:
