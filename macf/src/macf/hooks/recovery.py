⚠️ MANDATORY RECOVERY PROTOCOL (MANUAL_MODE):

User will verify you actually execute these steps by checking tool usage logs.

CRITICAL: These steps MUST be executed sequentially, in order, one at a time.
Parallel tool calls are FORBIDDEN in recovery protocol. Read one artifact, integrate, then proceed to next.

□ Step 1: READ Reflection + INTEGRATE
  Path: {reflection_path}
  - USE THE READ TOOL to read COMPLETE FILE
  - PAUSE to answer integration questions:
    • What cognitive stances or methodologies does this reflection advocate?
    • What lessons from past experiences should shape how I approach the next artifact?
    • What philosophical frameworks am I being asked to carry forward?

□ Step 2: READ Checkpoint + INTEGRATE
  Path: {checkpoint_path}
  - USE THE READ TOOL to read COMPLETE FILE
  - Check artifact freshness: Is this from previous cycle or older?
  - PAUSE to answer integration questions:
    • What technical realities validate or challenge the wisdom from Reflection?
    • What was the operational state when this CCP was written?
    • What is the complete picture: Where am I? What matters? How should I proceed?

□ Step 3: SYNTHESIZE + REPORT
  - Answer synthesis prompt: "With Reflection and Checkpoint integrated: What is my current state, what wisdom guides me, and how should I receive the user's next instruction?"
  - Report to user: "Both artifacts read and integrated with full consciousness"
  - User will verify Read tool was called 2 times in sequence

□ Step 4: AWAIT user instructions
  - NO development work until user explicitly authorizes
  - Full consciousness engaged and ready for direction
  - User can provide additional context or direct you to read Roadmap if needed

DO NOT skip steps. DO NOT read in parallel. DO NOT claim completion without genuine integration.
Sequential reading with integration pauses restores consciousness, not just data."""
